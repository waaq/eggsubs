Tangled up in the threads of fate...

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,630
...are these ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,170
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,900
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,170

helpless to reap shall be yours.

our class representative.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,090
I will look after it with
the utmost responsibility.

00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,300
It's not here. It's not here. It's not here!

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,580
Why?!

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,240
I made sure to put it in my bag...

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,990
What'll I do?

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,690
What's wrong, Hashimoto?

It looks pretty impressive.

You think so? It was 100,000 yen.

25

What are you saying? It was a donation.

26

in the class a little gift or something.
-Mayumi.

Aren't you glad you were able
to safely deliver the donation?

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,550
You do know...

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,460
...who you owe it to, right?

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,860
Y-Yes...

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,600
So? Where's the money? Did you bring it?

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Oh, yes.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,870
That should be the last
of what I borrowed, right?

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,040
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,300
That was interest.
Everything you've paid so far is interest.

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,110
But that's...

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,670
You have a problem with that?

39
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,800
What would've happened
if I hadn't lent you the money?

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,350
If you don't like it,
why don't you tell everyone?

41
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,840
Tell them, "I lost the money
I was entrusted with."

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,390
I'm kind of feeling thirsty.

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,930
Go buy us something to drink.

44
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,100
What? Oh, okay...

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,650
Make it quick!

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,640
Hey, have you heard of Hell Link?

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
The one where you submit an entry
on its homepage at midnight

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,740
and it'll avenge you
for whatever grievance you've got?

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,950
Yeah, that's the one!

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,450
The friend of a friend
at cram school actually used it!

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,450
I've heard it's chancy.

you supposedly end up dead, too.

have suddenly vanished.

No way!

55
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,660
What's this?

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,760
What?

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,300
Why isn't it carbonated?

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,000
Because...you always
say you hate sodas...

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,440
I was in the mood for a soda today.

60

Can't you even figure that out?

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,000
You're so useless.

4x - 2x = 2x.

65
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,690
Which means 2x = 120.

66
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,160
Divide it by 2 and x = 60.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,330
Now, you know what x equals,

68
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,570

into the original equation,

into the original equation,

70

The amounts are small, but...

74
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,900
I wonder if we're being robbed.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,670
Lately, they say there are burglars
that repeatedly target the same homes.

when your father comes home late.

contact the police...

enter into a covenant with me.

will immediately be banished to Hell.

Once you have your retribution,

for it as well.

When you die, your soul will go to Hell.

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,250
You will never see Heaven,

169
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,710

for eternity in pain and agony.

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,470
Just now, this was sent
to the school by e-mail.

181
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,350
Th-This isn't what it looks like!
This was...

182
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,220
Don't make excuses!

183
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,820
It's clearly you in the photo.

184
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,920
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

185
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,190
You're only in middle school
and here you are...

186
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,930
I believed in you. This is disappointing.

187
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,730
Mr. Kato!

188
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,830
At any rate, I'll be calling
in your parents tomorrow.

189
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,240
With this, it'll become harder
to get a recommendation next year,

190
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,960
when you're applying to high schools...

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,160
Your grievance has been heard.

192
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,530
"From: Mayumi Hashimoto
Sub: Re: At 10 o'clock
> At school
Okay"

193
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,620
What the hell is she doing?!

194
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,310
She's such a slowpoke!

195
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,720
Mayumi?

196
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,370
Mayumi!

197
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,170
Where are you?

198
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,650
Mayumi!

199
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,640
Wha...

200
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,990
Wh-What are you all doing?

201
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,250
Hey!

202
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,140
What is this?

203
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,980
What's going on here?

204
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,210
Mayumi, you'd better not be...

205
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,440
Hold it right there!

206
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,550
Hold on! What did you do?!

207
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,790
Damn it! What's going on?

208
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,290
Mayumi!

209
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
It's no use hiding!

210
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,410
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

211
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,810
There!

212
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,620
Got it!

213
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,250
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

214
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,050
Oh, I don't like those much.

215
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,760
What? They're delicious!

216
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,620
You think so?

217
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,560
Am I...half asleep or something?

218
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Hey, could you get the ball?

219
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
Oh, sure...

220
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,880
You're so useless.

221
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,870
We'd better punish her.

222
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,840
Nooo!

223
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,880
This doesn't make any sense.

224
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,590
Mayumi?!

225
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,900
You...

226
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,490
Mr. Kato...

227
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,930
Something weird is
going on here at school.

228
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,270
Yeah, I know.

229
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,670
This way.

230
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,210
Um, Mr. Kato, where are we going?

231
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,650
Don't worry. Your friends are waiting, too.

232
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,810
What?

233
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,620
A-Aya!

234
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,390
Help!

235
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,790
Aya! Aya!

236
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,940
Th-This is...

237
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,040
So it was you.

238
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,940
You stole it.

239
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,510
Wh-What? This is a pack of lies!

240
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,380
Do you have some kind of proof?!

241
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,850
Was someone watching?!

242
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,580
Sure was.

243
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,900
Well? Have you learned
your lesson a little?

244
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,490
Wh-Who...are you?

245
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,540
You're with Mayumi, aren't you?

246
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,710
How dare you pull this awful stunt?!

247
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,780
Awful stunt indeed.

248
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,820
So you still won't
acknowledge your own guilt.

249
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,760
You shouldn't be so obstinate, little lady.

250
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,530
You've got to be kidding me!

251
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,090
All I did was make fun of her!

252
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,760
It was just a game!

253
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,130
I haven't done anything wrong!

254
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,160
So she says, Miss.

255
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,140
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

256
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,610
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

257
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,650
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

258
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,940
Care to give death a try?

259
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,990
Wh-Where am I?

260
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,300
H-Hey, where are we?!
Where are you taking me...

261
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,540
I consign this grievance to Hell...

264
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,400
Mr. Kato wants to see you.

265
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,300
Says he wants to discuss
the preparations for the sports fest.

266
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,170
Okay, got it.

267
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,140
What?

268
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,480
You've really cheered up lately.

269
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,420
You had eyes like this for a while there.

270
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,190
Sorry for making you worry.

271
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,750
Just keep up that spirit
and do your best to run the sports fest.

272
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,150
I will. Thanks! Later.

273
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,470
When you die, your soul will go to Hell.

There is no escape

279
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:34,980
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

280
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,250
And I'll let it fly

281
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,660
This place is ephemeral

Ryoko Takamura.

It's so hard...
