It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:07,087
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:09,690
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,228
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:16,964
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:20,195
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,172
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:34,344
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:39,716
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:44,988
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:52,762
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,465
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:58,201
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:05,442
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:08,077
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:16,052
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,855
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:26,696
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:29,365
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:37,474
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,143

22
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:48,380
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

What?

176
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:12,503
So that's it. I knew you looked familiar.

177
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,706
So you're Yozo Kataoka's son.

178
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,875
That Heiwa Party man, who was
caught for accepting bribes.

179
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:22,013
Huh. You're the son that
led to Kataoka's fall, eh?

180
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:22,914
The one that was into drugs...

181
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,643
That was made up!

182
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:30,254
I've never done drugs.

183
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,984
I was framed by Inagaki!

184
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,958
True, I hear the drug test the police
administered came back negative.

185
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:44,268
But the media reported that
some evidence had been seized...

186
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,604
No such things exist!

187
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:51,008
That bastard... Inagaki just
wrote that article on his own!

188
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,311
They printed a correction right away,

189
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,781
but by then, the news of my old man
accepting bribes had gone public

190
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,516
and it had become this huge deal...

191
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,120
So it got lost in the
shadow of the bigger story...

192
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,957
I see. I didn't notice
the correction, either.

193
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,526
That Inagaki must've
had it all planned out.

194
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:12,663
All our assets have been seized
and my family has been torn apart!

195
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,365
It's all his fault!

196
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,800
Just to corner my old man,

197
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,070
Inagaki went so far as to
use the rest of the family!

198
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,773
It's unforgivable that
he's living a comfortable life!

199
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:24,842
After he took everything from us!

200
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:25,810
So...

201
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,311
So?

202
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,245
You tried to kill him?

203
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,945
Even if you managed that,
you'd just end up paying for it.

204
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,755
I know that.

205
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,091
That's why I put out a request.

206
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,422
But...

207
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,695
Request?

208
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,167
Revenge doesn't give rise to anything.

209
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,271
I understand how you feel,
but use that energy to fuel yourself.

210
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:57,141
Anger can be pretty useful
in making your way through life.

211
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:01,546
Think it over. It's too early
for you to abandon your life!

212
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,878
What the hell do you know?!

213
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,146
Hey! Wait!

214
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:14,025
I treat him and he gets pissed at me.

215
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,594
Talk about a bad return
on my investment.

216
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,729
Murder for hire, huh?

217
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,926
But there's no way he has
that kind of money right now...

218
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,893
Can't be...

219
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,694
It's excellent.

220
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,661
Really?

221
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,097
I'm impressed, Tsugumi.

222
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:56,601
With a taste like this,
I could even serve it at my place.

223
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,904
I only made it exactly
the way you told me to.

224
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,839
I bet your father will love it.

225
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,807
I hope so.

226
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,811
Wha...

227
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,335
Tsugumi!

228
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,656
Are you okay?

229
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:22,126
Yeah, I'm just getting started here.

230
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,562
Okay, I'm gonna take
Yoko and Azusa with me.

231
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,330
Come on, let's go to one more place.

232
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,531
Okay!

233
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,800
Then we'll be going, Ma'am.

234
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,535
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

235
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:34,305
What? I've got a hold
of myself, you dummy!

236
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:38,366
-If he really made the request...
-Come on, let's go.

237
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,675
Who's calling me at a time like this?!

238
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,117
"Tsugumi"
Tsugumi?

239
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:49,587
What is it?

240
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,522
Hajime, I saw it again.

241
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,257
What? Really?

242
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:54,392
Where was it this time?

243
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,194
I couldn't tell.
It's somewhere that's bustling.

244
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,262
Bustling?

245
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,131
Any kind of landmark type of thing?

246
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:00,564
"Snack Bar
Blue Sapphire"
Any kind of landmark type of thing?

247
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:03,134
"Snack Bar
Blue Sapphire"
Snack bar? Blue Sapphire?

248
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,771
Which means, it's really...

249
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,238
Oh, crap!

250
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,471
Over here, over here.

251
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,416
Inagaki!

252
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,442
Huh? Who the hell're you?

253
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,292
Y-You're Yozo Kataoka's...

254
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:31,162
Because of you, my family is in ruins!

255
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:35,232
In ruins? You moron, of course it is.

256
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,169
It's what you get for all the
bad things your old man did.

257
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,371
If you're gonna get mad,
get mad at your old man.

258
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:44,241
You used me to expose
what my old man was hiding!

259
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:48,346
Used you? I don't know
what you're talking about.

260
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,337
You bastard!

261
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,744
You brat!

262
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,293
Come on, let's go.

263
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,557
What was with that guy?

264
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,933
Hey, you okay?

265
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,901
You picked a bad opponent.

266
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,461
Inagaki's got a black belt in karate.

267
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:20,609
Is the one you made
the request to Hell Girl?

268
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,582
That bastard.

269
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,379
He's a nuisance.

270
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,487
You okay?

271
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,756
Yeah, I'm fine now.

272
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:35,326
You go back to your bar.
You still have to clean up, don't you?

273
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:39,730
I'll be fine. Let me get you some water.

274
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,357
Thank you.

275
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,366
Who are you?

276
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,846
I wasn't sure I believed it at first.

277
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,549
I thought there was
no way she could exist.

278
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,210
But she does!

279
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:05,389
Hell Girl really exists.

280
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,191
What kind of girl is she?

281
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,692
I don't know.

282
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,628
Where did you meet her?

283
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:12,323
I don't know.

284
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,433
You asked her to kill Inagaki?

285
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,577
But you're still taking action yourself.

286
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:30,104
After you've already asked
Hell Girl to get your revenge. Why?

287
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,919
What's that?

288
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,887
It symbolizes the covenant.

289
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:41,058
If I untie this thread,
the covenant will be established.

290
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:42,821
Thread...

291
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,131
But...

292
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,867
I see, so it's still not too late, right?

293
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:50,935
What?

294
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,369
All right.

295
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,940
Don't untie the thread.
I'll make Inagaki apologize.

296
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,275
Inagaki's death won't resolve anything.

297
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,879
We'll publicize everything that he's done.

298
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:05,883
I'll write the article,
so don't untie the thread.

299
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,373
Got it?

300
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,495
Hell Girl...

301
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:22,633
I don't know who you are
or why you're doing this.

302
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,902
But I can say one thing for sure.

303
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,637
You are...

304
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,366
...wrong.

305
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,992
He left? Alone?

306
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,393
With someone.

307
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:52,096
Yup. With a really gaudy woman.

308
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,466
Yup, yup. "Come on,
let's go to my establishment."

309
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,134
"Oh, okay, let's go," is how it went.

310
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:59,503
"Let's go," my ass!

311
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,198
-Just who does he think we are?!
-A woman?

312
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:17,621
What's this? It's in an
awfully run-down area.

313
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,790
Isn't it great? It's so shady!

314
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,692
I guess.

315
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,695
Here we are! There, please open the door.

316
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,356
Yes, Ma'am.

317
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:30,633
Wh-What the?!

318
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,644
Man, he reeked of alcohol.

319
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,650
"Depraved Journalism
Behind the Truth!!"

320
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,119
Let me out!

321
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,386
Hurry up and let me out!

322
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:23,654
"Depraved Journalism
Behind the Truth!!"
Hurry up and let me out!

323
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:24,421
Hurry up and let me out!

324
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,023
I said, let me out! Hey!

325
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:29,059
Feel like repenting
for your crimes now?

326
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,395
Crimes?! What crimes?!

327
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,298
All I did was expose the truth
that was hidden away!

328
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,366
I was even commended for it!

329
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,035
I've given no cause for
anyone to call me a criminal!

330
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,904
I see, so if it's for the
sake of this so-called "truth,"

331
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:43,274
are you saying it doesn't
matter what you do?

332
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,643
The truth that gets exposed is justice!

333
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:48,512
And as you see it,
that's what journalism is?

334
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:49,647
That's right!

335
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:53,684
What the masses want are
sensational stories called the truth!

336
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:58,122
I'm satisfying that desire!
I've done nothing wrong!

337
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:01,182
So he says, Miss.

338
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,930
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

339
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,334
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

340
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,030
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

341
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,367
Care to give death a try?

342
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:35,848
Where am I?

343
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,700
Where do you think you're going?!

344
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,600
Turn back the boat!

345
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:59,139
I consign this grievance to Hell...

346
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:14,097
You untied the thread?

347
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,170
Why?!

348
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,040
Even if everything is made public,
what good will that do now?!

349
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,168
What's been destroyed
can't be restored anymore!

350
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:29,546
You've got family, too, don't you?

351
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:31,241
You should understand.

352
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,717
Kataoka...

353
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:54,605
"Masaya Kataoka"

354
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:58,909
"Masaya Kataoka"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

355
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,308
"Masaya Kataoka"

356
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:20,158
Always a dead end

357
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:26,831
There is no escape

358
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:34,939
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

359
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:39,205
And I'll let it fly

360
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:47,619
This place is ephemeral

361
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:58,596
An eternity that binds me

362
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:05,603
Coming or going

363
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:17,174
All that passes by are dreams

364
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,327
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

365
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,593
Your name?

366
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:34,262
Akane Sawai.

367
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:38,332
You believe that man's actions
are not sincere?

368
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:41,602
He's not thinking about me at all!

369
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,805
He's doing it all for himself!

370
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:47,975
In truth, he wishes a failure
like me would just disappear!

371
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,844
Your wish?

372
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:53,047
Banish him to Hell for me!

373
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:55,979
Your grievance has been heard.

374
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:56,613
"Hell Girl
Spilled Bits"
Your grievance has been heard.

375
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,883
"Hell Girl
Spilled Bits"
Next time, "Spilled Bits".

376
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,383
"Hell Girl
Spilled Bits"
