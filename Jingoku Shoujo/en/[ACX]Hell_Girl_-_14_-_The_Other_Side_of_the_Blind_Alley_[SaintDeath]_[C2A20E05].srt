00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Make your decision after you've seen them!

176
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,110
What is it you're after?!

177
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,980
Don't you think revenge is meaningless?

178
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,070
I have a point blank question for you.

179
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,770
Isn't the cause of Mr. Kirino's death,
in fact, not suicide?

180
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,440
I am not sure why you
would ask such a thing...

181
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,750
That is what Mr. Kirino's daughter claims.

182
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,190
You cannot believe such
unsubstantiated nonsense.

183
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,860
But the idea that it is nonsense
is also unsubstantiated.

184
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,460
What are you driving at?

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,730
I only want to know the truth.

186
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,130
Regardless of what that truth might be,

187
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,670
I want to find an answer
that I can be satisfied with.

188
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,640
I believe we have
nothing more to discuss, then.

189
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,010
Let me see the mayor.
I want to talk to him.

190
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,840
Please leave.

191
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,110
You're here, aren't you?!

192
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,050
You can hear me, can't you, Mr. Kusunoki?!

193
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,580
You have some nerve talking like that!
You're just a freelance reporter!

194
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,150
That's why I can make it
as a freelance reporter!

195
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,590
Yoshiyuki.

196
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,040
I lost my parents when I was young
and I was raised by my grandmother.

197
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,840
But I lost her before I was able
to repay much of her kindness.

198
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,550
So when I see the elderly,
I just feel terribly rueful.

199
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,570
Though, I'm elderly myself now.

200
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,190
You're late today!

201
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,390
Sorry about that. I've just
been so busy with work.

202
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,090
Ms. Tanimoto, is your hip all right now?

203
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,700
How could it be all right?
I'm as good as finished!

204
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,100
The way you sound, I'd say you'll
be fine for a long time to come!

205
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,010
When the last director passed away,

206
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,140
the deeds to the land
and all the buildings here

207
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,780
went to some people with mob ties.

208
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,750
They were planning to
build a luxury condo here.

209
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,950
But if that happened, the elderly here
would have nowhere to go.

210
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,160
So I asked that they cancel those plans

211
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,230
and decided to make some
special concessions to the mob.

212
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,060
That was all there was to it.

213
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,070
Kirino found out about it
and tried to shake us down.

214
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,700
We couldn't possibly give in
to such a despicable threat.

215
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,410
So naturally, we refused.

216
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,910
He was probably in debt or something.

217
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,680
When he realized he couldn't
get money out of this,

218
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,080
he took his own life.

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,020
I do feel responsible.

220
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,320
Dad!

221
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,990
He said he wanted the money to send
his daughter to a university in Tokyo.

222
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,430
A man like that would
never commit suicide!

223
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,060
Do you realize what it is
that you are saying?

224
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,400
I did not have a hand in this.

225
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,990
But there is no doubt that
someone took action on my behalf.

226
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
It is up to you whether
you write about this or not.

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,080
But if I fall, this place
will be shut down.

228
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,110
What will happen if
this place is shut down?

229
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,210
What will become of
the elderly living here?

230
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,420
That's all I got today.

231
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,230
In the end, I didn't find out the truth
about your father's death.

232
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,470
I'll go see Kusunoki again tomorrow.

233
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,170
But...

234
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,570
Some things in this world can't be
split neatly into good and evil.

235
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,740
I think this case might be one of those.

236
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,480
So, forget about getting revenge.

237
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,670
You're sure to regret it.

238
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,910
I don't know what you're thinking,

239
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,480
even going so far as to hire
that has-been newshound,

240
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,620
but can we just end this with that?

241
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,790
Why are you doing this?

242
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,190
The mayor is losing heart.

243
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,990
I want you to stop
troubling him any further.

244
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,230
It's unbelievable how selfish
your thought process is!

245
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,000
Selfish?! You're the selfish one here!

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,700
What do you think will happen
if you bring my old man down?!

247
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,440
It'll bring trouble to a lot of people!

248
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,910
But you're the only one to
grieve the death of your old man!

249
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,050
You're trying to destroy this town
based solely on your emotions!

250
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,850
Get a clue already!

251
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,190
It's hardly unreasonable that
the townspeople are angry with you.

252
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,980
Hey, wait!

253
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,550
I won't write it.

254
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,300
I will keep this incident to myself.

255
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,500
In exchange, I have a request.

256
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,940
What might that be?

257
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,540
Please bow your head
to Mr. Kirino's daughter.

258
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,030
Please get down on your knees
and apologize to her.

259
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,220
You'll be going to college soon, right?

260
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,020
Then you'll get a job, get married...
It'll happen in no time at all.

261
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,890
I'd better work hard.

262
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,360
Don't say things like that.

263
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,830
I won't be able to do right by you
without the proper finances.

264
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,670
Now, I better get to work.

265
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,740
I promised her that I would
draw my own conclusions.

266
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,580
All I could come up with
was to ask this of you.

267
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,580
What are you doing?!

268
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,090
I only have you, now.

269
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,290
You're all I've got.

270
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,790
You mustn't listen to what this man says!

271
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,460
He's bound to come asking
for money later anyway!

272
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,060
I can't tell if you're in the wrong
or if Kirino's in the wrong.

273
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,030
But there's one thing I can say.

274
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,630
The feelings that
Kirino's daughter has are pure!

275
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,800
Unlike your corrupted son,
her feelings are pure!

276
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
What did you say?!

277
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,680
As a father, I envy Mr. Kirino
for having a daughter like her.

278
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,340
More than I envy you.

279
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,370
What kind of nonsense is this?!

280
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
"Shinkin Bank"

281
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,050
"Account Number 80765471
Ms. Saki Kirino
Matsunobe Shinkin Bank"

282
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,990
"Account Number 80765471
Ms. Saki Kirino
Matsunobe Shinkin Bank"
Your father had created an account
in your name, Ms. Saki Kirino.

283
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,890
Your father had created an account
in your name, Ms. Saki Kirino.

284
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,330
He had kept these in a safe-deposit box,

285
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,730
but the contract has expired,
which is why I contacted you.

286
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,800
Now, if you would be willing,

287
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,760
we would be happy to have you
keep your account with us.

288
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,280
If that's all you could save after
working hard at an honest job,

289
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,380
I can understand why you might
want to resort to blackmail.

290
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,680
And to die like that... I don't
know if it's pitiable or wretched.

291
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,270
Yes?

292
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,040
Hello, it's Shibata.

293
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,110
I'm going to bring Kusunoki
over to you now.

294
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,310
I'll have him apologize
for the incident.

295
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,680
Wait for me. Okay?

296
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,920
-It's all right.
-What?

297
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,990
It doesn't matter anymore.

298
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,020
What I should do is clear to me now.

299
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,660
Then, you're going to give up
on trying to get revenge?

300
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,200
Nothing can ever take
the place of my father.

301
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,900
No matter what he may have done,
he was a very kind father to me.

302
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,340
And those people...

303
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,570
Hold on a minute!

304
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,340
What happens to this town
is no concern of mine.

305
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,550
This is all I can do for my father.

306
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,750
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,870
Hey!

308
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,910
Father...

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,640
Your grievance has been heard.

310
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,370
Hello? Hello?!

311
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,020
What's wrong?!

312
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,680
My old man...

313
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,280
My old man disappeared...

314
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,100
Where am I?

315
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,330
You are in a boat ferrying you to Hell.

316
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,640
Hell...

317
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Yes.

318
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,230
I see. It must be that girl.
She's the one who...

319
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,250
Would it not be possible for me
to say a word of apology to her?

320
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,490
That would not be possible.

321
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,960
I see. So I can't do that.

322
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,530
I thought I had lived so I wouldn't
have any regrets, no matter when I died,

323
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,690
but it seems I've died
with just one regret.

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I consign this grievance to Hell...

325
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,180

326
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,950

Ryouzo Kusunoki,

327
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,920
"Matsunobe Town Mayor's
Mysterious Disappearance!!"
The mayor of Matsunobe Town,

328
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,190
"Matsunobe Town Mayor's
Mysterious Disappearance!!"
Has been missing for a week now

329
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,820
"Matsunobe Town Mayor's
Mysterious Disappearance!!"
And his whereabouts are still unknown.

330
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,920
And his whereabouts are still unknown.

331
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,090
That turned out well.

332
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,030
Why?

333
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,560
Because, that man did
some bad things, right?

334
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,230
So it was good.

335
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,070
Don't say it was good.

336
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,630
You're weird.
