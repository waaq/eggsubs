1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,910
It is said that life's
encounters are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,050
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,650
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,190
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,930
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,220
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,130
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,310
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,680
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,950
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:52,720
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,430
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,160
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,400
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,040
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,010
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,820
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:26,660
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,330
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:37,440

trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,100

Hey, Tsugumi?

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,470
Could it be you saw something?

32
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah.

Where? What place did you see?

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,950
A bookstore. They had old books.

35
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,750
Must be a used bookstore.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,310
What was the name of the store?

37
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,260
Then, what kind of bookstore was it?
What kind of books did they have?

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,730
What kind of books?

39
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,130
Like did they have manga?
Or novels? Or foreign books?

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,970
I won't know if you won't say anything.

41
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,730
Even just the title of a book...

42
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,040
Why can't you tell me?

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,500
Let me guess. Did they have
adult magazines or something?

44
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,050
Bull's-eye, huh?

45
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,850

with lots of pervy books...

The place Tsugumi saw

50
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,310
"Newly Remodeled"
was an old antiquarian bookstore

The owner is a middle-aged man who
has a parakeet and looks like a toad.

Where the heck is this store?

58

What's that girl up to?

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,280
I wonder what the Miss plans to do.

He looks like a toad, all right.

71
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,510
Now, what to do?

72
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,010

You know it, don't you?

75
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,680
We deal in most magazines of this
sort up to around the Showa year 40,
(Showa year 40 is 1965.)

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,480
But I don't recall any called "Hell Link".

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,510
Around when was it published?

78
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,060
W-Well, if you don't have it, that's fine.

79
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,430
Titles composed of 4 characters
are pretty common in every era.

80
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,100
What does the cover look like?

81
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Like is it realistic? Or psychedelic?

82
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,160
Clothed or unclothed?

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,210
Uh, I'm probably remembering it wrong.
Forget I asked.

84
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,480
Is this man unrelated to Hell Link?

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,310
My gut instinct tells me otherwise.

86
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,150
And what's up with that bird?

87
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,120
It's suspicious! Too suspicious!

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,520
The man or the bird?
Which is the boss of which?

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,990
No, that's not the issue! Get a grip, me!

90
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,160
Why was Ai here? Think!

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,590
There was a girl that
came by before noon, right?

92
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,430
Oh, do you know her?

93
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,170
No, I just saw her come in here
and it made me wonder.

94
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,440
What was she doing in here?

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,630
She read without buying.
The book over on that shelf.

96
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,150
We used to see them once
in a while in the old days.

97
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,450
Girls, who look like model students.

98
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,320
They probably came out of sheer curiosity.

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,350
But that was the first time
we'd seen a pretty girl like her.

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,700
Th-This is...

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,040

Th-This is...

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900

"Purgatory Girl"?

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,410
"'Have you heard of something
called Purgatory Link? '

105
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,750
An old friend of mine
brought it up one day.

106
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,150
I could not suppress my murderous rage,

107
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,060
and I finally tossed the letter addressed
to Purgatory Link into the mailbox.

108
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,030
Instantly, I felt a presence behind me.

109
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,300
I turned around to find a beautiful,
yet sweet looking girl.

110
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,340
Standing there was Purgatory Girl."

111
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,340
Beautiful, yet sweet looking, huh?

112
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,280

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,410
they say Hell Girl will
get revenge for you.

114
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,850

115
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,420

and Purgatory Girl

116

multiple pen names

Yes. He wrote a story
called "Purgatory Link".

158
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes. He wrote a story
called "Purgatory Link".

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,630
This is a story that Fukumoto wrote.

160
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,370
Fukumoto?

161
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,370
An artist who used to draw covers
and illustrations for us back then.

162
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,870
This is probably the only time
he also wrote the story.

163
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,540
The owner of Egurodo told me

164
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,840
that one of the illustrations
looks like Fukumoto's work,

165
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,750
but that the others were different.

166
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,810
I believe he changed his style on purpose.

167
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,850
Here it is.

to Atami on vacation.

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,270
This man in the cape?

174
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,370
That's right. And the one
next to him is Ohkouchi.

175
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,980
He was our main writer back then.

176
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,150
He worked as a pair with Fukumoto.

177
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,650
They were apparently good friends
outside of work, too.

178
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,880
It was right after this
that Ohkouchi passed away.

179
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,290
Ohkouchi passed away so suddenly,

180
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,260
we were in a real furor
about how to fill in for him.

181
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,270
That's when Fukumoto suddenly
showed up with that story.

182
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,640
The subject matter wasn't
entirely satisfactory,

183
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,270
but we didn't have time,

184
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,310
so we printed it with an eye
towards just filling the pages.

185
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,350
It was poorly received.

186
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,950
After all, neither the story
nor the art fit in with our style.

187
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,090
In particular, Purgatory Girl
was far too neat and clean.

188
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,290
This was?

189
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,430
Originally, a different illustration
was supposed to go there.

190
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,560
"Flesh and Cherry Blossoms"
Originally, a different illustration
was supposed to go there.

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,430
"Flesh and Cherry Blossoms"
I replaced it with another piece
that Fukumoto had drawn before.

192
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,830
I replaced it with another piece
that Fukumoto had drawn before.

193
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,240
The illustration itself was extremely good.

194
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,840
It just didn't fit the magazine.

195
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,670
It might be his greatest masterpiece.

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,470
This is the original Purgatory Girl.

197
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,010
Hell Girl...

198
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,280
Ai...

199
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,830
The protagonist in
"Purgatory Link" is an illustrator.

200
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,730
He has a beautiful wife.

201
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,440
One day, popular author, O,
has his way with the wife

202
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,670
and in her distress, she commits suicide.

203
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,050
The protagonist comes to feel
a murderous rage towards O.

204
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,310
And then...

205
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,090
Fukumoto's wife was an
incredibly beautiful woman.

206
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,620
But one day, she took her own life.

207
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,330
It wasn't clear why she committed suicide.

208
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,330
And Fukumoto never talked about it.

209
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,300
It was right after that,
that Ohkouchi passed away.

210
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,240
The cause of his death
was never clear, either.

211
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,470
It's similar.

212
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,600
Huh?

213
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,510
The wife commits suicide
and the friend dies...

214
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,110
In terms of the storyline,
it's exactly the same.

215
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,280
Oh, that's true.

216
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,920
He must have thought of the story
because of their deaths.

217
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,350
Where is Mr. Fukumoto now?

218
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,220
I haven't the slightest.
Not even if he's alive or dead.

219
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,600
After that, the industry fell into decline
due to regulations and such.

220
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,570
I heard rumors that Fukumoto
became a movie billboard artist, but...

221
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,500
If you're all right
with a 50-year-old address...

222
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,010
"Minowabashi"

223
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,910
"Umezawa Hall of Photography"

224
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,610
"Umezawa Hall of Photography"
50 years...

225
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,240
"Umezawa Hall of Photography"
The town must look
completely different by now.

226
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,410
"Miwanobashi Shopping Arcade"
The town must look
completely different by now.

227
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,470
"Miwanobashi Shopping Arcade"

228
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,950
Could Fukumoto still be living there?

229
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,120
Things couldn't have
possibly changed more.

230
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,400
The town was gone.

231
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,230
"Do Not Enter"
The town was gone.

232
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,330
"Do Not Enter"
There were some
private homes here and there,

233
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,930
but it could no longer be called a town.

234
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,010
An old apartment building
that must have been elegant once.

235
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,340
It's practically deserted now.

236
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,700
He's here!

237
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,290
Mr. Fukumoto? Mr. Fukumoto?

238
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,060
Mr. Fukumoto!

239
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,460
You're home, aren't you?!

240
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,400
There's no doubt that he's in there.

241
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,130
What can I do?

242
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,470
Mr. Fukumoto, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

243
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,290
"Yamanashi
Mandarin Oranges"

244
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,760
"Yamanashi
Mandarin Oranges"
Mr. Fukumoto,

245
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,950
"Yamanashi
Mandarin Oranges"
I'd like you to tell me about this girl.

246
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,930
It's your work, Purgatory Girl.

247
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,200
But I've met her in real life.

248
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,140
Her name is Ai Enma.
She is known as Hell Girl.

249
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,840
"Yamanashi
Mandarin Oranges"

250
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,020
Come on in.

251
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,880
Y-Yes, sir.

252
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,290
I have no time left.

253
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,030
I don't want to be bothered
by unnecessary things.

254
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,760
No time?

255
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,500
My body is beginning to
fail me in various ways.

256
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,040
I could drop dead today
and it wouldn't be surprising.

257
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Then I will get straight to the point.

258
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,840
You've met Hell Girl, haven't you?

259
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,850
"Flesh and Cherry Blossoms"

260
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,150
"Flesh and Cherry Blossoms"
What's written in here is something
you actually experienced, isn't it?

261
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,830
Wh-What is this nonsense?

262
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,400
I want to know just who she is.

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,770
And why she does this.

264
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,910
There's a homepage called Hell Link.

265
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,980
There are rumors that if you write
in there, your grievance will be avenged

266
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,210
and young people are accessing that site.

267
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,320
There are even people
who have really gone missing!

268
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,220
I would like to stop this somehow!

269
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,220
In my time, it was in the
newspaper's missing persons column.

270
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,630
I heard about it from Ohkouchi.

271
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,870
He asked, "Have you heard
the rumors about Hell Link?"

272
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,470
The rumor went that if you
wrote a letter to Hell Link,

273
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,740
your grievance would be avenged for you.

274
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
The contact address was written

275
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,420
in a blank space in the
newspaper's missing persons column.

276
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,190
But only those with a
strong grievance could see it.

277
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,560
At the time, I thought it
was of no concern to me.

278
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,790
But...

279
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,410
For the first time in my life,
I seriously considered...

280
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,310
When I thought that...

281
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,310
"Your grievance shall be avenged."

282
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,590
It all happened just
as it's written there.

283
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,470
"She told him, 'However,
once you have your retribution,

284
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,510
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

285
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,810
Curses come home to roost.

286
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,750
After you die, your soul
will also go to Hell."'

287
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,280
That's right.

288
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,620
And this is the price for it.

289
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,310
The seal that marks me
as being bound for Hell.

290
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,560
When I entered into that covenant,
I thought that was a long way off.

291
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,570
Thinking back now, my life has
been a battle against this seal.

292
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,700
"Choice Movie Premiers
All Production Companies"

293
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,470
"Choice Movie Premiers
All Production Companies"
In an attempt to forget about the seal,

294
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,340
In an attempt to forget about the seal,

295
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,780
there was a period where
I devoted myself to my work.

296
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,280
I also tried seeking
salvation through religion.

297
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,150
In utter despair, I even
became absorbed in gambling.

298
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,120
Then, thinking to at least
make myself useful to my fellow man,

299
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,710
I threw myself into volunteer work.

300
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,330
But no matter what I did,
nothing lifted my spirits.

301
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,570
This seal proclaims my fate.

302
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,970
That when I die, I will go
to Hell to suffer for eternity.

303
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,640
I'll show you my final piece of work.

304
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,700
Ai Enma...

305
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,610
When I go to Hell,
I may get to see her again.

306
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,080
That is the one thing I look forward to.

307
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Look forward to?!

308
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,750
She ruined your life!

309
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,320
You're wrong about that.

310
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,190
The one who ruined my life is Ohkouchi.

311
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,430
But!

312
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:06,200
Back then, Ohkouchi carried
a handgun for his own protection.

313
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,100
If I had tried to avenge my wife myself,

314
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,270
he might have turned the tables on me.

315
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,140
I am even grateful to her.

316
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,350
Just what in the world is Hell Girl?!

317
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,280
A being that is not human.

318
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,250
No, perhaps she was once human.

319
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,190
There are texts from as early
as the middle of the Edo period

320
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,360
that have accounts of Hell Girl.

321
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
The Edo period...

322
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,760
No, likely, it goes
back further than that.

323
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,570
Probably the
Azuchi-Momoyama period or so...

324
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,560
The Warring States period...

325
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,810
Why did you decide to
write "Purgatory Link"?

326
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:57,250
Perhaps that was not my will, but hers.

327
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,920
At any rate, I had to tell someone.

328
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,680
Someone? Is that...

329
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,360
Yes. You.

330
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,570
You would cry for me?

331
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,510
Mr. Fukumoto?

332
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,370
At last, we meet again.

333
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,810
You haven't changed.

334
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,400
You're as beautiful as ever.

335
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,910
Will I see Ohkouchi in Hell?

336
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,060
Hell is...

337
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,360
...a pretty vast place, too.

338
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,180
Always a dead end

339
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:26,860
There is no escape

340
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:34,960
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

341
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,230
And I'll let it fly

342
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,640
This place is ephemeral

343
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:58,620
An eternity that binds me

344
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,630
