It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,894
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,632
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:14,170
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,906
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

Tsugumi!

35
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:45,732
Huh?

36
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,734
Look at this!

37
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,569
Isn't it awful?!

38
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,603
What happened?

39
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,205
The boys! It's the boys!

40
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,608
That Suzuki guy yanked on it.

41
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,443
And it broke...

42
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:01,814
Yup! But Suzuki just
laughed and ran away!

43
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,882
It's unforgivable!

44
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:03,716
Right?

45
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,018
Why don't you grab him
and make him apologize?

46
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,687
Apologizing won't do any good.

47
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,289
That's right, because he broke it.

48
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,392
I know, let's send him to Hell.

49
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,928
Oh, great idea! Let's do that!

50
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,998
Let's get Hell Girl
to send Suzuki to Hell!

51
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,533
He's a nasty guy anyway.

52
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,525
I'd be happier if he weren't around.

53
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,971
You gave me one hell of a scare.

54
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,339
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:04,744
I thought my heart would stop when
I got the call from the hospital.

56
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,075
Sorry...

57
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,087
He was a good person, wasn't he?

58
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,789
That driver...

59
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,493
It was my fault,
but he was apologizing so much...

60
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,861
Oh...

61
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,590
"Reception"

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,634
lf...

63
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:34,273
If I'd died in that accident...

64
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:37,877
Would you have hated that driver?

65
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,913
Y-You dummy, what're you saying?

66
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,049
He was a good person, wasn't he?

67
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:47,713
But if I'd died, wouldn't you
have thought about killing him?

68
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,390
I don't know...

69
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,655
I don't know anymore...

70
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,467
I owe you an apology.

71
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,128
I'll stop now.

72
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,305
Hell Girl...

73
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:10,243
From now on, I'll never
even mention her around you.

74
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,278
So, you forget about it.

75
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,380
Hajime...

76
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,371
Here, wipe your tears.

77
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,143
O-Okay...

78
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,663
"Japan's Cherry Blossoms"

79
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,198
Yes, that's right.

80
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,833
Oh, I see.

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,469
How does the schedule look
for the other party?

82
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,036
-Yes. Yes, yes.

83
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,105
-Mother...
-Yes. Yes, yes.

84
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,407
Okay, then please take care of it.

85
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,509
Is it okay?

86
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,672
Is it really okay for it
to just end like this?

87
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,243
Is it okay?

88
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,287
Hey, good news.

89
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,187
What?

90
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,723
I'm going to Hawaii to cover a story.

91
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,492
Hawaii?

92
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,495
It looks like I can fudge the expenses,
so let's go together.

93
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,265
It's a simple story,
so it'll be like going on vacation.

94
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,668
You can swim in the ocean, Tsugumi.

95
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,329
Hajime...

96
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,073
What's wrong? Don't wanna go?

97
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,563
It's Hawaii!

98
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,911
Of course, I'll go.

99
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,414
Yeah? Okay, it's settled.

100
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,816
Then I'll make the arrangements
for the tickets right now.

101
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,184
Let's see...

102
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,585
I'll go make some tea.

103
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,887
Sure.

104
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,789
Huh? That's strange...

105
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,026
I was sure I'd saved that
crooked travel agent's number...

106
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,789
Crooked stuff is wrong.

107
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,031
Tsugumi?!

108
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,168
You know Sentaro?

109
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:42,969
What?

110
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,104
You know him?

111
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,799
Hell Girl...

112
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,299
Tsugumi!

113
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,817
Please stop this...

114
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,518
Come on, please, just stop it!

115
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,355
I won't get in your way!
I won't chase after you any more!

116
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,191
So release my daughter!

117
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,183
I'm begging you!
Stay away from us from now on!

120
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,902
Hajime...

121
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,506
Tsugumi, you're back?

122
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,575
We can't leave it like this.

123
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,910
We won't be able to end it like this.

124
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,081
To find out why...
To find out what she wants to tell us...

125
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,484
We have to meet Hell Girl.

126
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,888
Tsugumi... But you...

127
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,880
I want to know the answers, too.

128
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,703
Ai, what's the matter?

129
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,173
It's nothing, Grandma.

130
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,543
Are you troubled about something?

131
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,347
No, I'm fine.

132
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,009
Could it be that you're...

133
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,546
I'm fine...

Mutsumi Village, huh?

136
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,329
Mutsumi Village, huh?

137
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,068
They were here.
Hell Girl and that boy...

138
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,170
Sentaro...

139
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,941
Who is he?
How is he related to Hell Girl?

140
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,274
Why would she ask if you know him?

141
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,489
She's there?

142
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,598
She's not?

143
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,740
Don't scare me, damn it!

"Yamano Inn"
We almost never have any guests here
during this season.

146
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:13,686
We almost never have any guests here
during this season.

147
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:18,991
It's cold and if it snows,
it blots out the beautiful view.

148
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,893
Ah, I see.

149
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:26,565
We've usually had snow by this time
every year, so you're very lucky.

150
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,834
Oh, it's started.

151
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,568
Huh?

152
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,302
Snow...

153
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,804
Oh, you're right.

154
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,608
I can't believe it,
just as we were talking about it.

155
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,144
Is the bath ready?

156
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,579
Yes, please help yourselves.

157
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,182
Tsugumi, go take a bath.

158
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,817
Alone?

159
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,285
What?

160
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh...

161
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,890
Sorry, that was a weird thing
for me to say.

162
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,620
Huh? No...

163
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:58,597
Then I will show you the way.

164
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,996
See you later.

165
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,834
What am I supposed to do
in situations like that?

166
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,614
Do you feel it?

167
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,487
Do you feel something when
you look at this view?

168
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,155
I'm coming in...

169
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,282
Tsugumi, Father's here...

170
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,822
Hajime...

171
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,806
Do you feel something
when you look at the view?

172
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,307
That's what she asked?

173
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,308
Yeah.

174
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,911
What does that mean?

175
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,904
This is the first time we've ever been
to this out-of-the-way place.

176
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,801
Thank you. You're such a darling.

177
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:43,902
It's nothing.

178
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,038
Isn't it great that
the weather has cleared?

179
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,774
And there isn't too much snow
on the ground, either.

180
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,642
Yes.

181
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,278
Whereabouts do you plan to visit?

182
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,212
If you'd like,

183
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,416
there happens to be a place behind us
that offers a great view.

184
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,787
Ma'am, is this place far?

185
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,722
What?

186
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,224
Oh...

187
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,894
Well, it's about
20 minutes from here, but...

188
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,731
Oh, really?
Please tell me how we can get there.

189
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,132
Um, but it's winter right now...

190
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,550
Local stories?

191
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,787
I'm not originally from around here, so...

192
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,990
Oh, why not inquire at the temple?

193
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,024
The temple?

194
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,627
It happens to be right on your way
to the waterfall.

195
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:46,231
The head priest there
may know those kinds of things.

196
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,233
"Shichidouji"

197
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,758
"Shichidouji"

198
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:20,566
Please. It's just stem tea,
but it will warm you up.

199
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,227
Thank you for the tea.

200
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,905
You have certainly traveled a long way,
coming from Tokyo.

201
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,475
And at this time of year...

202
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,212
Covering stories for a magazine
sounds like hard work.

203
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,280
Yes, well...

204
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,948
"Freelance Reporter
Hajime Shibata"

205
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,016
"Freelance Reporter
Hajime Shibata"
Mr. Shibata...

206
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,052
"Freelance Reporter
Hajime Shibata"
But what a coincidence...

207
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:40,452
But what a coincidence...

208
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,783
Oh?

209
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,070
Old stories, is it?

210
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,076
The truth is, I am not exactly from
these parts, either.

211
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,445
I was hired for the job,
if you will.

212
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,247
I had no idea.

213
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,283
I am sorry I could not be of help.

214
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,944
Oh, not at all.

215
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,889
That's brown sugar candy.

216
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,791
They're delicious.

217
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,622
Brown sugar candy?

218
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,735
It's a time-honored flavor.

219
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,404
You're right, it's really delicious.

220
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,806
Isn't it, though?

221
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,799
Oh, yes. I just remembered something.

222
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,671
Do you know of a practice
called Seven Sending?

223
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,720
Seven Sending?

224
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,324
It is apparently a practice that was
once observed in these parts.

225
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,294
In order to ask for good health...

226
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,363
...and abundant harvests
of the mountain god,

227
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:03,302
once every 7 years, they supposedly
made a sacrifice to the mountain...

228
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,938
...of a girl that just turned
seven years old.

229
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,101
A child of seven to the mountain?

230
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,011
That's the same age as me.

231
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:13,545
"Seven"
That's the same age as me.

232
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,849
"Seven"
Seven is a number that represents
the yang of ying and yang,

233
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,517
"Seven"
so it is an auspicious number.

234
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:18,851
So it is an auspicious number.

235
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,553
In other words,
it symbolizes auspicious events...

236
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,622
...and in turn,

237
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:27,593
it is also said to be the number
that invites auspicious events.

238
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,896
So, to invite auspicious events
to occur in the village,

239
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,990
they sacrificed a seven-year-old
child to the god?

240
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,203
This temple was supposedly built...

241
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:16,508
...to appease those young souls
wandering in the mountains.

242
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,510
Hence, the name...

243
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:18,877
"Shichidouji"
Hence, the name...

244
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,247
"Shichidouji"
Yes, and the man who
built this temple...

245
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:27,549
"Shichidouji"
...is actually the founding owner
of this brown sugar candy maker.

246
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:36,261
It was built over 400 years ago
in the Azuchi-Momoyama period.

247
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,164
The owner was supposedly
originally from around this area,

248
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,700
but left due to some circumstance...

249
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,363
...and later went on to succeed
as a brown sugar candy maker.

250
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,617
Though, I understand...

251
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:04,590
...that no one related to the founding
owner works at the shop anymore.

252
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,259
But even now, several times a year,

253
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,263
they send us these candies
as an offering.

254
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,700
What is the shop called?

255
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,938
Yes, that's the coincidence
I mentioned earlier...

256
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,574
It's called Shibataya.

257
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,609
What?

258
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,008
Shibata?

259
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,803
So that was it...

260
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,477
That was it.

261
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:42,749
Head Priest, what was the name of
the founding owner of Shibataya?

262
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,300
"Shichidouji"

263
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,800
"Shichidouji"

264
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,236
"Shichidouji"
I'm told that his name was Sentaro.

265
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,743
From the way you look, I guess
you couldn't find her, either.

266
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,390
You struck out, too, huh?

267
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,793
We sure are a hopeless bunch.

268
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,128
Don't say that.

269
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,292
Honestly!
Where could the Miss have gone?

270
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,402
It's not even for any jobs.

271
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,005
She's just been disappearing
without warning lately.

272
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,474
Well, you know,
the Miss is a young lady...

273
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,275
Ouch!

274
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,344
You think this is a time
for joking around?!

275
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,781
You didn't have to throw that at me!
That hurt!

276
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,616
Oh? Back again.

277
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,947
-What?!
-What?!

278
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,322
Oh...

279
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,358
You meant that one...

280
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,026
Hold on...

281
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,323
Just maybe...

282
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,440
Is this the place?

283
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,271
The view that you saw?

284
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,838
Someone piled these up?

285
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,734
This is...

286
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,277
Hey!

287
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,835
Ai Enma?

288
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,983
Gotcha!

289
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,687
No! Let go, Sentaro!

290
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,489
-Sentaro?

291
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,022
-You can't catch me!
-Sentaro?

292
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,658
-You can't catch me!
-Hell Girl and Sentaro...

293
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:56,991
So, the two were childhood friends...

294
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,097
You're here.

295
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,064
Hell Girl!

296
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,731
It still remained.

297
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,016
The abominable bloodline
had not died out.

298
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,919
It was that blood
that led me astray.

299
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,082
Abominable? What in the world
are you talking about?

300
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,067
Stop!

301
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,269
Stop...

302
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,905
Please! Stop!

303
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,040
Please!

304
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,531
Stop, Sentaro!

305
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,274
Tsugumi, you okay?

306
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,185
You were buried...

307
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,516
What?

308
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,749
You were buried?

309
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,494
Were you? By Sentaro...

310
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,795
What?!

311
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,464
Do you mean to kill me once again?

312
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:10,168
Transcending time...
Again, like you did then?

313
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,905
Though I have accepted it all...

314
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,271
I will not be killed!

315
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,972
Be gone!

316
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,758
She's here, just like I thought!

317
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,460
You can't, Miss!

318
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,331
Stop this! You mustn't kill
at the behest of your emotions!

319
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,634
You will be banished to Hell!

320
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,637
Even so, I do not care!

321
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,300
This is bad. Her heart
is completely ruled by hatred!

322
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,786
Run!

323
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,777
What are you doing?! Hurry!

324
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,931
Miss, stop this!

325
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,262
Be gone!

326
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,379
Miss!

327
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,087
-Miss!
-Miss!

328
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,359
I do not care.

329
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:57,831
So be it!
Consign this grievance to Hell!

Miss, you've done nothing wrong.

It's the same in every era.

341
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,540
Humans are creatures that hurt
others for their own happiness.

342
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,810
By covering their sins with other sins.

343
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,914
And when they do, bitter grudges are born.

344
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:55,050
