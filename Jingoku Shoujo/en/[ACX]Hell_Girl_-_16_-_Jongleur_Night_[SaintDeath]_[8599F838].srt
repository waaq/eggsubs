00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,860
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,990
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,590
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,130
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,870
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,240
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,050
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,190

Ano hi to ima o

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,950
In this craziness, uncertainty

Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,730
In this craziness, you gave me life

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,570
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,240
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:37,380
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,020
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,290
Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,530
"The little lark, who forgot his way home"

24
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:08,400
"Is amidst a vast field of wheat"

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:18,420
"He called out seeking his mother"

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:27,260
"But there is only the rustle
of wheat in the wind"

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,270
Tsugumi!

28
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,380
Who are you?

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,450
I am Ai Enma.
You summoned me, remember?

30
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,610
Hell... Girl?

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,190
Take it.

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,930
If you really want retribution,

33
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,660
untie that red thread.

34
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,200
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,940
The object of your vengeance
will immediately be banished to Hell.

36
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,210
However,

37
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,810
once you have your retribution,

38
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,510
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

39
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,550
Curses come home to roost.

40
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,860
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

41
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,730
You will never see Heaven,

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:42,760
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

43
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,310
All that remains is for you to decide.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,750
You saw something again, didn't you?

45
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,920
Who is it this time?

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,790
I don't know.

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,690
But I saw a poster.

49
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,590
For a circus.

50
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,250
A circus poster...

51
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,360
"A Night Among Traveling Entertainers"

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,290
"Happy Circus"

53
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,250
"Happy Circus"

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,920
"Happy Circus"
Come on over!

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,350
Come on over!

56
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,980
It's the fun Happy Circus!

57
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,460
Tightrope walking and beast masters!

58
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,290
We're here again this year!
The Happy Circus!

59
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,990
It's the Happy Circus that
comes just once a year!

60
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,700
Wow! It's a real circus!

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,200
I had no idea they still had these.

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,940
Come on, little lady.
I hope you have fun!

63
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,040
Hajime, hurry up!

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Right.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,450
Hey, kid, you come on over, too.
It'll be lots of fun!

66
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,320
It's him again.

67
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,610
Sheesh, how does he
get wind of these things?

68
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,750
Who is it?

69
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,980
Who accessed Hell Link?

70
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,600
What?

71
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,280
That's amazing!

72
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,580
You want to do a story on us?

73
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,350
Yes, I was so surprised, to be honest.

74
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,920
I had no idea a circus
like this was still around.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,260
It's just so, I don't know, nostalgic.

76
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,550
Then, you came all this way
from Tokyo just to see us?

77
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,080
I just happened to find you
guys online and got curious.

78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
You just happened to find us, huh?

79
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,360
Drop dead! I wish you'd
just drop dead already!

80
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,390
Never mind them.

81
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,860
They go through the
same thing every night.

82
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,630
It's like a ritual
for that married couple.

83
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,600
And enter the lover.

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,630
Up until last year,
that was his role, though.

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Bull's-eye!

86
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,920
That's the world's greatest
knife thrower for you!

87
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,250
But don't hit me, okay?

88
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,930
Well, shall we start looking
around from over there?

89
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,950
What are you doing out here,
little girl?

90
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm waiting for my father.

91
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,520
Your father? You must mean the reporter.

92
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,160
But why is he covering
a circus like this?

93
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,330
Don't know.

94
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,630
I see.

95
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,870
Aren't you able to
do something, ma'am?

96
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,870
M-Ma'am?!

97
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,470
I mean, you belong to the circus, right?

98
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,240
O-Of course, I can.

99
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,300
Show me! Show me!

100
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,550
The girl?

101
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,720
Yes. You know, the one that escaped
from the box she was skewered in.

102
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,320
Oh!

103
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Could I meet with her for a bit?

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,330
I want to talk to her.

105
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,030
Talk?

106
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,430
It's nothing major,

107
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,200
but her performance was
quite impressive, so...

108
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
I won't be able to let you.

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,270
She's the troupe leader's favorite.

110
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,640
But, I guess you did come
all this way from Tokyo...

111
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,940
Come with me.

112
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,680
She's in there?

113
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,890
Wait here a minute.

114
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,120
So you're here to do a story on us?

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,590
You sure are an odd one.

116
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,860
Doing a story on a lousy circus like this!

117
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,800
The name itself is a mockery to begin with!

118
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,170
Happy Circus, my ass!

119
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,640
You think so, too, don't you?

120
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,140
You again!

121
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,210
Come on, get over here.

122
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,850
Hey, what are you doing?!

123
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,480
Don't touch me, Mokku!

124
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,820
All right, all right.

125
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,020
-If you want someone to talk to,
I'll keep you company.

126
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,690
-Hello.
-If you want someone to talk to,
I'll keep you company.

127
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,810
-Come on in.
-If you want someone to talk to,
I'll keep you company.

128
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,060
She's got quite the taste.

129
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,600
Come with me.

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,270
I'll help you.

131
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,470
So don't think of doing something
stupid like trying to get revenge.

132
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,770
Revenge?

133
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,710
You accessed Hell Link, right?

134
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,110
Anyway, come with me.

135
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,180
Stop this!

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,010
What?!

137
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,680
You're scared, right?

138
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,090
Don't worry. I'll take you someplace
where he can't get to you.

139
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,790
-So come with me!
-No!

140
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,620
Let go! Let go!

141
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,230
You idiot! Don't yell!
I'm trying to help you!

142
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,350
No! No!

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
This isn't good, mister.

144
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,270
The deal was that you
were only going to talk.

145
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,790
Mokku!

146
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,300
Okay, I think it's time you left.

147
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,420
Hajime!

148
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,320
Look! Look at this box!

149
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,160
We're going.

150
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,330
So long.

151
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,580
Let me out!

152
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,350
Hone Onna?!

153
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,180
-Mokku, let me out!
-What the heck are you doing?

154
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,550
So, it wasn't that girl?

155
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I was sure it had to be her, too...

156
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Anyway, let's eat.
We'll go back again later.

157
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,820
You messed up again!

158
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,270
That was because someone had
tampered with the heel...

159
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,960
Tsugumi?!

160
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,300
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

161
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,890
Tsugumi!

162
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,460
Get a hold of yourself, Tsugumi!

163
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,960
That girl is being bullied!

164
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,260
What?

165
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,670
Please, save her!

166
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,670
That girl?

167
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,640
She's got scars all over her body.

168
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,480
She's being beaten all the time!

169
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
All the time?

170
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,280
But she had no such scars...

171
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,620
Don't tell me...

172
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,790
Twins?

173
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,660
That was the trick
behind escaping the box.

174
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,960
It was the other one that
hated the troupe leader.

175
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,670
What kind of place was the girl in?

176
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,580
A place like a cage...

177
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,340
All right, got it!

178
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,970
I'm coming, too!

179
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:52,460
"The little lark, who forgot his way home"

180
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,470
"Is amidst a vast field of wheat"

181
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,200
This is awful...
"Is amidst a vast field of wheat"

182
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,410
"He called out seeking his mother"

183
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,640
That's...
"He called out seeking his mother"

184
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,410
You untied it?
"He called out seeking his mother"

185
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,520
"He called out seeking his mother"

186
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,480
"But there is only the rustle
of wheat in the wind"

187
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,450
Look after her!
"But there is only the rustle
of wheat in the wind"

188
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,280
"But there is only the rustle
of wheat in the wind"

189
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,350
How does it look?

190
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,500
Why the hell are you here?!

191
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
I'll explain later!

192
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,300
Hurry up and get away from here!

193
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,040
Or you'll be sent to Hell!

194
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,970
Hell?

195
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,970
Never mind! Just run!

196
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,570
What are you doing?!
Let go! Let go of me!

197
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:53,390
"Forgetting his way home and lost"

198
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:02,100
"The lark is alone in the wheat"

199
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,280
Working hard, I see. Good, good!

200
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,300
Here's a reward for you.

201
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,090
Here, say, "Ah!"

202
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,920
Ah!

203
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:44,400
"Though no mountain fox cries out"

204
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:54,140
"After sunset is the forlorn moonlight"

205
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,010
I said, let go of me!

206
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,720
-Hurry!
-What is your problem?!

207
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,750
Hurry up and run!

208
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,240
You're not making any sense!

209
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
It can't be!

210
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,590
Wait!

211
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,590
So it was her...

212
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,270
Where am I?

213
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,620
What is this?

214
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,300
The circus troupe of Hell!

215
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,900
Looks like the star is
finally taking the stage.

216
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,240
We expect a lot from you.

217
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,130
What?

218
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,310
Now, ride around.

219
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,240
Ride around?

220
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,760
Come on now. If you don't hurry,
you'll be caught by those arms.

221
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,130
There's no way I can do this!

222
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,860
So you can't even do
something like that?

223
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,590
Then I guess there's no helping it.

224
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,520
S-Stop this!

225
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,820
Please, stop this!

226
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,290
Stay away!

227
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,620
Nooo!

228
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,440
I wonder how long you'll
be able to hang in there.

229
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,810
Please, help me!

230
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,250
I-I don't want to die!

231
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,980
Then repent to your older sister.

232
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,590
Poor girl.

233
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,290
She suffered terribly because of you.

234
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,590
Then, could it be that you people are...

235
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,230
Demeaning your older sister,
so that you would be the favorite...

236
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,430
What a dirty thing to do.

237
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,500
Repent to your older sister!

238
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,340
Why do I have to apologize to her?!

239
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Because of her, I'm always
just half a person!

240
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,210
I want to stand on stage alone, too!

241
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,150
What's wrong with that?!

242
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,810
I haven't done anything wrong!

243
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,880
One of me is more than enough!

244
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,340
I wish she would just disappear!

245
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,020
So she says, Miss.

246
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,130
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

247
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,170
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

248
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,710
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

249
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,640
Care to give death a try?

250
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,760
What is this?

251
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,660
Where are we going?

252
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,570
Stop!

253
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm telling you to stop!

254
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,410
No! I don't want to!
I don't want to go!

255
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,680
-Stop! Come on, I said, stop!

256
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,820
-I consign this grievance to Hell...
-Stop! Come on, I said, stop!

257
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,350
Nooo!

258
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,500
I guess they're all leaving.

259
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,400
Yeah...

260
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,110
Where's Mokku?

261
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,470
Have you seen Mokku?

262
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
Troupe leader.

263
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,920
Ah, that looks good on you, Yumi.

264
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,640
It fits you perfectly.

265
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,990
She's smiling.

266
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,990
All right! Time to leave!

267
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:54,710
"Yumi"

268
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,180
"Yumi"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

269
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,310
"Yumi"

270
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,030
Itsudatte yukidomari de

271
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:26,710
Keshite nigerarenai

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:34,810

Sugite yuku wa yume

278
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,370
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

279
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,900
"Save me"?

280
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,940
That's what the girl said?

281
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,170
Yeah.

282
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,480
She's at a sanatorium shrouded in fog.

283
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,150
Do not go.

284
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,480
Turn back.

285
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,450
Hell Girl...

286
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,780
I'm going.

287
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,820
I won't let you banish anyone to Hell.

288
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,150
Do not go.

289
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,060
You must not go.

290
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,060
Hajime, I hear a music box.

291
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,300
"Hell Girl
Glass Scenery"
Next time, "Glass Scenery".

292
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,800
"Hell Girl
Glass Scenery"
