00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:04,885
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:07,021
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:09,623
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:14,161
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,897
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:20,230
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:29,105
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa

"Spilled Bits"

24
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,154
Sawai!

25
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,451
Sawai!

26
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,059
Sawai, why don't you come to school?

27
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,994
Everybody's worried.

28
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,155
Could I at least just talk to you?

29
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:47,702
If you won't say anything, we can't
even find a way to resolve this.

30
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:50,204
Come on, Sawai!

31
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,372
Sawai!

32
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,810
Mr. Fukazawa, that's enough for today...

33
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,777
But...

34
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,644
It is true that she isn't feeling well.

35
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,246
Sawai, I'll come again tomorrow.

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,547
Well, then, please excuse me.

37
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,893
"Secret Place"

38
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,641
I have found a very wonderful place.

39
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,677
I have uploaded a picture
of it to the message board,

40
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,269
so please take a look at it.

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,496
It truly is wonderful.

42
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,598
I would like to go there.

43
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,534
I ended up staying home
from school again today.

44
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:58,005
The teacher has no regard
for my feelings, either.

45
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,842
I just cannot bring myself
to like my teacher.

46
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,513
I can't understand why he
goes to such lengths for me.

47
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,310
It makes me uncomfortable.

48
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,914
"Anemone"

49
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:22,096
Come on, Sawai, could I
at least just see you?

50
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,597
Sawai!

51
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,902
The teacher must have
his own various troubles.

52
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:31,105
I go to that place often myself
on my way home from school.

53
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,707
It brings me peace.

54
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,811
I could never tell anyone
things like this in real life.

55
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,680
This is our secret,
just between you and me.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,882
A secret just between the two of us.

57
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,474
Please promise me.

58
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,157
Sawai, at least let me hear your voice!

59
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,726
-Sawai! Sawai!
-It's so strange.

60
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,464
That such a place could bring such peace.

61
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,166
I would like to go there, too.

62
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,829
Lately, I feel like I don't belong,
even in my own house.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,143
Sawai! Sawai!

64
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:13,814
I am writing this e-mail
in the yard of that abandoned house.

65
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,418
Something bad happened at school
that has made me depressed.

66
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,751
Maybe I'll stay home
from school tomorrow, too.

67
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,760
Do you know about Hell Link?

68
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,696
Sawai! Sawai!

69
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,598
I've heard of it.

70
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,067
That if you write in the name of
the person you have a grudge against,

71
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,525
Hell Girl will supposedly avenge you.

72
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,447
I found the site the other day.

73
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:51,180
I cannot make up my mind whether
to write in my teacher's name or not.

74
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,223
Sawai!

75
00:05:56,223 --> 00:06:00,557
I think it would be okay to write it in.

76
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,661
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

77
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:15,009
Are you feeling sorry for your teacher?

78
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:20,777
You never know, the teacher might
be wishing for it to happen, too.

79
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:32,850
"Yoshiki Fukazawa"

80
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,555
"Send"

81
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,231
You called?

82
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,917
Well, I don't know if someone such
as myself could be of any use to you.

83
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,655
Mr. Kashiwagi told me you were
an extremely passionate teacher.

84
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,892
Being passionate does
not mean I am capable.

85
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,961
I will not trouble you overly much.

86
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,163
Ah...

87
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,528
This is it.

88
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,336
Okay, everyone, quiet down!

89
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,475
This is Mr. Shibata and he's a journalist!

90
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,111
He's researching educational issues,
so all day today,

91
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,681
he'll be observing class
and talking to you guys,

92
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,551
so everyone be sure
to cooperate with him.

93
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,120
Got that?

94
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,020
Um...

95
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,464
Uh, um, I'm Hajime Shibata.

96
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,594
Uh, I'll try not to get
in your way, so I hope we can...

97
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,795
Come on now, be quiet!

98
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,148
Curses come home to roost...

99
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,895
Ai.

100
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,332
What's the matter, Ai?

101
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,468
No, it's nothing.

102
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,265
It's nothing at all.

103
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,236
You're all so quiet.

104
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,416
It's just that you seem so normal now.

105
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,518
When you were so noisy this morning.

106
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,753
That's kind of like socializing...

107
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,088
Socializing?

108
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,289
Right?

109
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,895
If your friends talk to you, you sort of
end up paying attention to them.

110
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,497
But I mean, your teacher was talking.

111
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:54,835
The teacher is an adult,
so we think he'll be able to take it.

112
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,503
We're kids, after all.

113
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,339
If we quietly listened to
what the teacher was saying,

114
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,240
you never know what people
might say about you later.

115
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,479
You're fine with this, Mr. Fukazawa?

116
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:09,506
Well, children these days
are all pretty much like this.

117
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:16,646
By the way, you guys,
have you heard of Hell Link?

118
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,359
I have, but...

119
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,928
It's just a rumor, right?

120
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,564
I tried searching for it,
but I didn't find it.

121
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:27,432
Have you heard any rumors
of any kids who have accessed it?

122
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:33,140
We're all stressed out, so...

123
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,878
Everyone's got one or two people
they feel like cursing.

124
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:42,116
Maybe that's the reason
a rumor like that has spread.

125
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,486
They're good kids at heart.

126
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:48,689
You try not to be
too impertinent, too, eh?

127
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,247
Yes, Sir...

128
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,563
"Fire Hydrant"

129
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,365
"Fire Hydrant"
Did you know about Hell Link,
Mr. Fukazawa?

130
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,067
Did you know about Hell Link,
Mr. Fukazawa?

131
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:04,538
Oh, I had heard about it in a casual way.

132
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,740
You've never seen it?

133
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,142
Why do you ask?

134
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:14,047
Well, I thought you might have one
or two people you'd like to curse, too.

135
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,819
Mr. Shibata, are you sure that wasn't
what you were really researching?

136
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,255
Oh, no, not at all.

137
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,524
Someone I'd like to curse, huh?

138
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:26,982
Well, there might be those
who'd like to curse me, though.

139
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,901
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,335
-Please excuse me...
-Mr. Fukazawa.

141
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:40,040
I hear Sawai in your class
still hasn't been attending.

142
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,677
We cannot have this. We need
you to counsel her properly.

143
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,878
Yes, Sir...

144
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,880
She can stay in the
nurse's office if she attends.

145
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,849
Attendance is attendance, after all.

146
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,851
Non-attendance is an issue.

147
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,154
It affects the reputation of this school.

148
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,850
Can't we just dismiss her
from school, once and for all?

149
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,194
Guess I got nothing.

150
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,965
Akane.

151
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:38,899
Everyone lives a life where
not everything goes their way.

152
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,135
And that applies to you
even more at your age.

153
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,606
There's no way you
can keep this up forever.

154
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,972
You know that, too, don't you?

155
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,078
Why don't you come to school?

156
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,480
If you come, you'll feel that much better.

157
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,750
You'll wonder what you'd been
agonizing over all this time.

158
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,585
That's just how it is.

159
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,851
In point of fact,
you behaved cheerfully early on.

160
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,426
Please say something.

161
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,587
I won't know anything if you won't talk.

162
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,599
Even if I told you...

163
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,934
What?

164
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,904
Even if I told you, I don't
think you'd understand.

165
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,071
Why not?

166
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,643
You can earnestly do your work
without any doubts

167
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,178
and live a normal life,

168
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,942
and I don't think someone like
that could understand my feelings.

169
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,153
The social environment of
the classroom is very hard.

170
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,423
Even if I know it's wrong,
I still have to do what's expected.

171
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,660
Even if I know it's bad,
I still have to play along.

172
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,297
Over and over and over.
That's what I don't like.

173
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:45,832
You've never even imagined it
might be like that, have you?

174
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,569
You thought everyone behaved
whatever way they wanted, right?

175
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,205
People might seem to be having fun,
but that's just appearances.

176
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,969
That's why I say you can't understand.

177
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,980
Please leave me alone already!

178
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,283
Why do you bother with me so much?!

179
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:08,722
Isn't it because it's a problem
for you that I don't go to school?

180
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,724
If you have a student who doesn't attend,

181
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,993
it damages your position, so...

182
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,928
Don't talk like you know anything!

183
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,692
Don't think you're the
only one who's special!

184
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,728
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,577
It's exactly as you say.

186
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,881
I wasn't thinking of you,
but of my own position.

187
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,717
Even today, the reason I came here

188
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:40,520
is because the vice principal
pressured me about you.

189
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,822
It's about appearances...

190
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,653
It's all about appearances.

191
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,395
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

192
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,529
What?

193
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,897
I'll come again.

194
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:55,664
You shouldn't worry
your mother too much, okay?

195
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:11,051
I do not know what I should do anymore.

196
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:15,122
Am I in the wrong or are
those around me in the wrong?

197
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,225
I don't know anymore.

198
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,293
What a coincidence.

199
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:26,266
I was thinking similar thoughts.
I do not know what I should do.

200
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:31,169
Maybe I really will quit going
to school, once and for all.

201
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,956
"Faculty Room"

202
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,970
I was surprised.

203
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,074
I'm the one who kept
pestering you to come to school,

204
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,811
but when you actually came,
it made me feel even more worried.

205
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,802
How stupid is that?

206
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,214
What is it? Did something happen?

207
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:22,956
I don't really know myself...
what I should do, so...

208
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,423
But...

209
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,495
Because you revealed how you honestly
felt yesterday, that's why...

210
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,532
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,939
Mr. Fukazawa.

212
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,907
Hold on a minute.

213
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:50,317
Can you guess where I am right now?

214
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,321
At school! I can't
believe it myself, either.

215
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,484
I'll e-mail you again when I get home.

216
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,727
"I'll e-mail you again when I get home.
Anemone"

217
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,495
"Anemone"

218
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,196
"Anemone"
What are you doing?

219
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,798
What are you doing?

220
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,168
Did you know?

221
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:45,505
Were you exchanging e-mails with me,
knowing that I was Anemone?!

222
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,207
What?

223
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,708
What is the meaning of this?!

224
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,544
W-Wait a minute.

225
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,078
Well, what about it?!

226
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,114
No, that's not true!

227
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,515
What?

228
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,676
That's not true.

229
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,757
I'm shocked.

230
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,359
I had no idea you were Anemone.

231
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,851
I didn't mean to trick you.
Please forgive me.

232
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,267
I had no other outlets.

233
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,071
It was the only way
I could take it anymore.

234
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,272
When I was a student,

235
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,742
I couldn't understand why
someone wouldn't come to school,

236
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,279
but when I became a teacher,
I understood for the first time.

237
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,882
It's so ironic.

238
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,787
But my correspondence
with you was my salvation.

239
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,522
Same here.

240
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:41,761
I'm sorry. I wrote in
your name on Hell Link.

241
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,423
You met her? You met Hell Girl?

242
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,568
What kind of girl was she?

243
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,436
Somehow, she seemed
like a lonely person.

244
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,067
I see.

245
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,276
I wish I could meet her, too.

246
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,947
Say...

247
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,354
Won't you send me to Hell?

248
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,855
What?

249
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:12,892
I'm tired. I want to be out of my misery.

250
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,725
I'm sick and tired of it all.

251
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,465
Please.

252
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:36,416
If you really want retribution,

253
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,078
untie this red thread.

254
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,956
However,

255
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,858
once you have your retribution,

256
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:49,195
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

257
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,596
Curses come home to roost.

258
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,636
Fukazawa's so pathetic.

259
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,973
He acts like he's understanding,
but he's sort of off the mark.

260
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,498
Seriously, it's like, stay away from me.

261
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,954
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

262
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,491
So how many times must I tell you?

263
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,859
Being considerate of your students is fine,

264
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,396
but what the parents are most
concerned about is career paths!

265
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:28,163
If you cater to the bad students,
and the entire class's grades...

266
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,981
All that remains is for you to decide.

267
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,184
Your grievance has been heard.

268
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,212
This is...

269
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,048
I can go straight to Hell from here, right?

270
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,417
I'm right, aren't I?

271
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,319
Mr. Fukazawa...

272
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,689
Do you know the meaning
of what you've done?

273
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,023
What?

274
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,650
Look.

275
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,895
Sawai...

276
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,598
Any human who has entered
into the covenant with me

277
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,000
will never see Heaven,

278
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,608
and after death, their soul will
wander for eternity in pain and agony.

279
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,210
You didn't know that, did you?

280
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,547
You were too wrapped up in yourself.

281
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,917
Thinking you'd take a
pleasant trip out to Hell?

282
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,285
No...

283
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,752
Sawai...

284
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,860
Mr. Fukazawa, I will
be coming later as well.

285
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,762
So please wait for me.

286
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,565
In the depths of Hell...

287
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,362
Sawai...

288
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:17,936
I consign this grievance to Hell...

289
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,557
Missing?

290
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,991
Mr. Fukazawa is?

291
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,328
Yes, and he was such
a passionate teacher, too.

292
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,764
Perhaps he took things too much to heart.

293
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,461
I hope he does not do anything misguided.

294
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,643
How'd it go?

295
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,613
I guess you can never tell with people.

296
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:56,983
They say that enthusiastic
teacher's gone missing.

297
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,818
And he seemed so earnest...

298
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,588
Maybe the kids these days...

299
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,389
Tsugumi?

300
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,058
Hey, you okay?

301
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,192
Tsugumi?!

302
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,695
Is it all right this way?

303
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:11,297
With Hell being Heaven...

304
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,787
What?

305
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,404
It's all right, Ai.

306
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:22,208
If they're all right with it,
then it's all right.

307
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,804
There's no need for you to
give it any further thought.

308
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,516
But...

309
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,090
It's so strange.

310
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,856
That such a place could bring such peace.

311
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,798
This is our secret,
just between you and me.

312
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,501
A secret just between the two of us.

313
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,332
Please promise me.

314
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:54,474
Your grievance shall be avenged.

315
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:58,678

Your grievance shall be avenged.

326
00:24:31,592 --> 00:24:34,862
Tsugumi had another mysterious vision.

327
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:38,899
Not only that, but this time,
it wasn't of a future incident.

328
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:43,904
The man wrote that story
shortly after the war.

329
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:45,506
Did you meet her?

330
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:48,376
And did the same thing happen to you
as what happened in the story?

331
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:51,212
Please tell me what
happened 50 years ago.

Tell me why Ai Enma
