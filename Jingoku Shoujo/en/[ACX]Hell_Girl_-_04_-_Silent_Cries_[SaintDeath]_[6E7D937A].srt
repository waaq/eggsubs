Tangled up in the threads of fate...

...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

Oh, Candy!

57
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,592
and seems to have broken her leg.

58
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,961
I just got a call that they would
be bringing her over right away.

59

Suzuki?

60
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,865
Oh, I'll leave it to you
to take care of that dog.

61
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:12,235
I have to go see
Assemblyman Koizumi's dog now.

62

But Doctor...

More importantly, don't forget
to give the poodle its 5 o'clock shot.

65
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,943
It'll be bad if we let
that actress's dog die.

00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,772
Okay, I'm counting on you.

Ms. Sekimoto.

69
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:52,475
Um, thank you for everything
you did for Candy.

70
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:57,538
I was so upset at the time
and I didn't thank you properly, so...

71
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,754
Where's the doctor?

72
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:08,391
Oh, he stepped out just now
to go see a patient.

73
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,052
I see.

74
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:16,132
Don't worry, I'll pass along
your thanks to the doctor.

75
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:20,036
So anyway, are you feeling
a little better now?

76
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:23,706
Yes. I still can't get used to being alone,

77
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:27,744
but moping about it forever
won't help anything, either.

78
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:31,180
Besides, I think Candy was happy.

79
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,708
After all, she was in the care of a
good doctor like Dr. Honjo until the end.

80
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,950
Well, please give the doctor my regards.

81
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,836
Candy...

82
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:57,101
I just gave you some painkiller,
so you should feel better soon.

83
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,991
...please, don't die!

84
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,357
Don't leave me alone!

85
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:28,132
Ms. Sekimoto!

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,776
I'm sorry for calling you out here.

87
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:38,214
It's all right. It's not as
if I have anything to do at home.

88
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:40,739
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

89
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,755
What do you mean?!

90
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,357
So, the truth is, right then,

91
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,461
a phone call came in
from Assemblyman Kawai and...

92
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,162
Golf, is it?

93
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:56,966
I don't mind, but with someone
of my caliber accompanying you,

94
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,735
wouldn't it be more of a hindrance for you?

95
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,203
Doctor...

96
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:01,003
Yes?

97
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,406
Oh, no, not at all.

98
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,608
-Doctor!
-That was just a fluke.

99
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:09,846
Never mind that. Your approach shot
on the 5th hole was brilliant.

100
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:14,751
No, mine was a fluke. I just got lucky.

101
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,552
Yes. Okay.

102
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,554
-Doctor!
-The last Tuesday of the month?

103
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,188
I happen to have that free.

00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:19,856
''Mon 2pm- (house calls)

I happen to have that free.

105
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:20,857
''Mon 2pm- (house calls)
Tues Charity Animal Consultation
Weds 9-11am (vaccinations)''
No, no, it's completely fine.

106
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:21,691
''Mon 2pm- (house calls)
Weds 9-11am (vaccinations)''
No, no, it's completely fine.

107
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:22,091
No, no, it's completely fine.

108
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,581
Doctor!

109
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:27,130
It can't be...

110
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,067
Then, did Candy receive
no treatment at all?!

111
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:34,170
He treated her after he got off the phone,

112
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,873
but it was already too late by then.

113
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:41,410
If only I'd forced him to
get off the phone right then,

114
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,012
this wouldn't have happened.

115
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,781
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,683
I know an apology doesn't
make it any more forgivable,

117
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:51,788
but seeing you, I just
couldn't keep it quiet anymore.

118
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:55,825
That's the kind of place that clinic is.

119
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,894
It can't be true...

120
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:00,630
She was in so much pain!

121
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,699
For a phone call like that?!

122
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:06,793
It just can't be true!

123
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,232
Forgive me...Junko.

124
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,941
Candy...

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,091
If only I hadn't taken you
to a doctor like that...

126
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,460
Did you see the paranormal special
on TV yesterday?

127
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,529
It was super scary, wasn't it?!

128
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,365
That reminds me,
have you heard of Hell Link?

129
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,067
Yeah, I've heard of that!

130
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,902
That site you have to go to at midnight

131
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:42,805
that'll avenge your grievance
or something, right?

132
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,040
Yup, that's right.

133
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,075
I heard someone really used it
at Fuurin High School.

134
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:46,939
What?! No way!

Who are you?!

148
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:10,993
I am Ai Emma.
You summoned me, remember?

149
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:13,860
Then, you're Hell Girl?

150
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,061
Take it.

151
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,779
If you really want retribution,

152
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,115
untie that red thread.

153
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:37,153
You will enter into a covenant with me.

154
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:41,249
The object of your vengeance
will immediately be banished to Hell.

155
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:45,962
So I just have to untie this?

156
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:47,596
However,

157
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,465
once you have your retribution,

158
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:52,301
you will have to pay the price
for it as well.

159
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,536
Price?

160
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:55,938
Curses come home to roost.

161
00:11:55,938 --> 00:12:01,410
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

162
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,113
You will never see Heaven,

163
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:09,676
and you will wander for eternity
in pain and agony.

164
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:15,019
Well, that's only after you die, though.

165
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:20,960
Stop!

166
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:32,868
All that remains is for you to decide.

167
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,654
I just have to pull this...

168
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:48,190
I just have to untie this thread

169
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,057
and I can have my revenge.

170
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,801
I can't do it! I just can't do it!

171
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,269
Forgive me, Candy!

172
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,340
You suffered so much
as you were dying, but I...

173
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,830

00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:18,687
got up close and personal
with the man embroiled in this incident.

177
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,556
There's proof of what you did.

178
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:21,457
Why don't you acknowledge your guilt?

179
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,158
''Massive Misappropriation of Funds!!
Closing In On The Truth!''
Why don't you acknowledge your guilt?

180
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,459
''Massive Misappropriation of Funds!!
Closing In On The Truth!''
You think they'll let you off the hook

181
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,627
after what you've done?!

182
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,628
Please answer us!

183
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:26,788
The company president has...

184
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,298
Proof?

185
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:31,567
Yes, as long as we have proof,

186
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,804
some TV station should be willing
to do a piece on that doctor...

187
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,073
-That won't work.
-What?

188
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:41,477
The clientele of that clinic includes lots
of politicians and celebrities.

189
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:46,215
Even if we gave the media this story,
it'd get hushed up right away.

190
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,717
But at this rate, Candy will have...

191
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:51,948
No, not just Candy!
This concerns other dogs, too!

192
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,425
I'm never going to forgive that doctor.

193
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:59,121
Everyone brings their pets to him
because they trust him!

194
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:03,258
Please, Ms. Sekimoto!

195
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,868
I understand.

196
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:07,859
''Gold Animal Clinic''

197
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,642
It's dark, so watch your step.

198
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,117
What happened to this one?

199
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:23,886
She broke her leg in an auto accident.

200
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:28,591
If she'd had surgery right away,
it wouldn't have gotten this bad, but...

201
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,593
More importantly, let's hurry.

202
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:34,154
We need to get out of here by 10,
before Honjo gets back.

203
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,603
The patient charts are useless.

204
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,405
They've all been forged, so it
looks like proper care was rendered.

205
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:46,208
Instead, help me over here.

206
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,679
He charges for expensive medicine
that he never even used,

207
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,816
so the inventory might not match up.

208
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,317
Seven boxes of Anmytal.

209
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:58,721
Um...Yes, seven boxes.

210
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,924
Why? They all match up.

211
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,727
That's strange. It shouldn't...

212
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,354
What are you doing?!

213
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,866
You're...

214
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:13,936
I've heard about it all from Ms. Sekimoto!

215
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:18,032
Candy was suffering, while you were
on the phone talking about golf!

216
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,944
What are you talking about?

217
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:25,181
I don't know what Sekimoto told you,

218
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,650
but I did everything in my power for Candy.

219
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,084
I won't be fooled!

220
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:31,487
You killed Candy!

221
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:35,090
I'll tell the media about
everything you're doing!

222
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,525
I see.

223
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:39,195
And that's why you were looking for proof.

224
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,731
So? Did you find your proof?

225
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,566
If you don't even have proof,

226
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:46,702
I'd rather you didn't make
groundless accusations.

227
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,938
You could ask the parties
directly involved, if you like.

228
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:49,905
What?

229
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,713
How about it?

230
00:15:57,713 --> 00:16:00,238
Am I such a terrible doctor?

231
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:05,354
I can't really understand
what you're saying.

232
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:09,058
Talk to me properly so I can understand!

233
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,993
That's awful...That's too awful...

234
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,863
Come now, what's wrong?

235
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:16,765
If there's something
you want to say, say it.

236
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,334
Please stop!

237
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,069
I've heard enough!

238
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:23,672
They may just be a means
of making money for you,

239
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:26,308
but to their owners,
they are their precious pets!

240
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:30,212
Take Candy! She was
the only family Junko had!

241
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,447
Family?

242
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,949
You call that filthy dog family?

243
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,752
You probably found it
on the street somewhere, right?

244
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:38,621
Besides, it's because dogs
like that come here

245
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,624
that the hospital becomes dirty and smelly.

246
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:43,359
What do you think this place is?

247
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,561
It was also for the good of the hospital

248
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:48,731
that a dog like that hurried up and died!

249
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:49,565
-Ow!
-Go on! Get out of here!

250
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,467
Please stop, Doctor!

251
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,003
I'll let you off the hook just this once,

252
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:56,739
but if you come around making
groundless accusations again,

253
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:58,841
I'll sue you for slander!

254
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,742
Don't think you'll ever find
another job in this industry!

255
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:08,817
It was better that she hurried up and died?

256
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:11,718
I won't forgive him. I won't forgive him!

257
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,398
Your grievance has been heard.

258
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:37,870
Ai, I'll leave your under-kimono here.

259
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,844
Thank you, Grandma.

260
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:33,635
Calling me up in the middle of the night
for a measly dog...

261
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,297
Just you watch, I'll charge you
a fortune for it.

262
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:47,883
Damn it...

263
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:51,086
What was someone doing there...

264
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,644
I have a broken bone...

265
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,163
He sure got himself
into a spectacular crash.

266
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:02,892
Let's move him out.

267
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,199
What're you...

268
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:18,981
What's this place?

269
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,249
The hospital?

270
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,151
What's going on?

271
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,252
Are you a doctor?

272
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,487
Hey, I've got a broken leg!

273
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,288
Do something about it for me!

274
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:28,257
Did you see yesterday's game?

275
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,625
Wasn't that an amazing homerun?

276
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,893
Who cares about baseball?!

277
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:33,862
-No, that was because
the pitcher slipped up.
-Hurry up and look at my leg!

278
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,931
A pitcher slip up? Come on!

279
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,733
It was a miscommunication, I'm sure.

280
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:41,103
I mean, it was a straight pitch
smack dab in the middle.

281
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:43,505
-Hey, you people,
you've got a patient here!
-You were watching, too?

282
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:46,909
-Quit chitchatting and start treating me!
-I say the credit should go to the batter.

283
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:47,342
-Quit chitchatting and start treating me!
-He had his elbow
tucked in like this and bam!

284
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:48,777
-Come on, I told you
-He had his elbow
tucked in like this and bam!

285
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,512
-No one cares about baseball!
-He had his elbow
tucked in like this and bam!

286
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,214
-Hurry up and do something about my leg!
-That was a slip up.

287
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,982
That's right.
Even I could've hit that homerun.

288
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,585
You people, are you listening to me?!

289
00:19:56,585 --> 00:20:00,077
Please, I'm begging you,
do something about this leg!

290
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,726
We will now begin the operation.

291
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:05,818
What?

292
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,666
What the heck's wrong with him?

293
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,936
The thing is, we can't understand
a word of what the patient's saying.

294
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,137
It's my leg!

295
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,739
-I have a broken bone in my leg!
-I guess we'll start
by cutting in around here.

296
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:18,797
What?

297
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,312
Where do you people
think you're cutting into?!

298
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:24,980
That's not the right place! It's my leg!

299
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,448
It's my leg that's injured!

300
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,817
Stop it!

301
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:32,321
Do you feel like repenting
for what you did now?

302
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:36,725
To you, animals may be a means
for making money,

303
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:40,529
but for pet-lovers,
they're a part of the family.

304
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:43,699
Family?! Don't be ridiculous!

305
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:46,134
They're no different than I am!

306
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:48,804
They dress up their animals in weird outfits
and take them to parties!

307
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:51,240
They use their animals
as a means of showing off!

308
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,343
Why am I the only one
that has to be treated like this?!

309
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,445
I haven't done anything wrong!

310
00:20:56,445 --> 00:21:00,115
So he says, Miss.

311
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:03,285
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

312
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:06,054
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

313
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:08,750
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

314
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:12,320
Care to give death a try?

315
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,465
Wh-Where am I?

316
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:32,581
What is this place?

317
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,276
Where are we going?

318
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:37,920
Answer me!

319
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,721
Doctor, it hurts.

320
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,590
-What?!
-It hurts!

321
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,326
-Doctor, it hurts.
-It hurts, Doctor!

322
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:46,595
-Stop this! Stay away! Stay away from me!
-Doctor!

323
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:49,364
-Stop this! Stay away! Stay away from me!
-Doctor, it hurts!

324
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:54,165
I consign this grievance to Hell...

325
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,952
Ms. Sekimoto!

326
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:13,622
Junko, you came to see me off!

327
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,591
I heard you were leaving the city
and going back home...

328
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:18,260
I'm sorry. Because of me...

329
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,996
It's okay. I should be the one apologizing.

330
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:26,702
Besides, I think I can find work
with animals away from the city, too.

331
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:29,538
The 10:09 Nozomi destined
for Fukuoka will be departing.

332
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,006
-The 10:09 Nozomi destined
for Fukuoka will be departing.
-Well, I have to go.

333
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:33,542
I'll let you know when I find a job.

334
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,770
Bye.

335
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:40,716
Father, Mother, Candy...

336
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:43,385
I'm sad that l can't be with you,

337
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:45,654
but I'm going to try to
hang in there a little longer.

338
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:50,523
So, please watch over me from up there.
