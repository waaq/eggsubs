I've handed over to you people?!

Hey, sorry for being late.

00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,837
Mr. Kisaragi, what's going on here?

67
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,939
He showed up again yesterday!

68
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,568
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We're doing the best we can...

69
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:34,048
Akimoto, sorry, but could you
go buy me some coffee?

70
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:34,883
What?

71
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:38,019
I just got off the night shift
and I can barely keep my eyes open.

72
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,486
I understand!

73
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,029
We've pretty much narrowed down
who the suspect is.

74
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,797
What?

75
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:53,568
I'm sorry it's taken so long.

76
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:58,172
But in all honesty, the situation
calls for acting with prudence.

77
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,469
Meaning?

78
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:13,187
That detective?!

79
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,890
With a member of the police force
involved in the crime,

80
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,060
it makes things quite difficult.

81
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,064
In particular, that Akimoto's
the son of an influential family,

82
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:26,158
so if we handle this clumsily,
it'll all get covered up.

83
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:30,505
So it was a detective...

84
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,373
We will arrest him!

85
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:37,679
But given this situation,
we must move carefully.

86
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:41,749
Please have patience for just
a while longer until we have solid proof.

87
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:45,420
But Mr. Kisaragi, my daughter
is at a breaking point!

88
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,752
-Any more and...
-Mr. Takamura!

89
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:52,427
I understand.

90
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:55,964
Please act like you know
none of this when Akimoto gets back.

91
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:59,634
Avoid behaving oddly at all costs.
Do you understand?

92
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:00,768
Yes.

129
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,164
Because you summoned me.

130
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,699
Thank goodness!

131
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,835
At last, it'll be over.

132
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:18,101
Has this past year been that hard?

133
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,944
It began with love letters.

134
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:25,279
I found them in the mailbox every day.

135
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,317
And then they turned into weird gifts.

136
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,579
Weird?

137
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:36,390
That's fantastic.

138
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,392
He was trying to get your attention.

139
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:41,362
It's pretty sick, though.

140
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,852
And then?

141
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:47,502
I started getting phone calls
and e-mails, too.

142
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,471
I changed my e-mail address
many times, but it was no use.

143
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:52,507
Quite the resourceful guy.

144
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:56,544
After that, he would follow me
practically every day.

145
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,147
And finally, I don't know how he got in,

146
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:00,214
but he let himself into my room

147
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:00,815
"Today, I found this lovely dress in town.
I just know you'll look good in it."
But he let himself into my room

148
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,717
"Today, I found this lovely dress in town.
I just know you'll look good in it."
While we were out and...

149
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,706
"Today, I found this lovely dress in town.
I just know you'll look good in it."

150
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,522
It was no use, no matter
how many times we changed the locks.

151
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,157
I can't take it anymore!

152
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:12,693
Even worse, I can't stand to watch
what it's doing to my mom and dad!

153

155
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:28,075
Take it.

156
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:32,079
If you really want retribution,

157
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,377
untie the red thread around his neck.

158
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:44,926
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

159
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:49,363
The object of your vengeance
will immediately be banished to Hell.

160
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,698
To Hell?!

161
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:51,933
However,

162
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,734
once you have your retribution,

163
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:57,705
you will have to pay the price
for it as well.

164
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:59,240
Price?

165
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,710
Curses come home to roost.

166
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,513
If you enter into the covenant,

167
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:07,981
you, too, will go to Hell.

168
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:16,357
We're talking about after you die, though.

169
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:18,659
You'll never see Heaven,

170
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:25,724
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

171
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,139
No, stop it!

172
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,405
No! Nooo!

173
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,816
What?

174
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:55,184
All that remains is for you to decide.

175
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,625
That bastard!

177
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,344
You'll never see Heaven,

178
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:51,046
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

179
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,224
Why you!

180
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,630
Wha?!

181
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,962
H-He's dead?!

182
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,434
Sorry for being late, Dad!

183
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:16,944
Welcome back.

184
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:18,112
Detective Kisaragi?!

185
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,747
We figured out who your stalker is.

186
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:20,614
Really?!

187
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:23,981
Yeah, we're going to
go arrest him right now.

188
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:47,742
"He asks her where her home is,
but she doesn't know"

189
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:53,381
"He asks her what her name is,
but she doesn't know"

190
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:59,019
"Meow, meow, meow-meow,
meow, meow, meow-meow"

191
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,192
"All she does is cry,
the little kitty cat"

192
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:11,732
"The policeman dog doesn't
know what to do and goes..."

193
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:16,570
"Woof, woof, woof-woof,
woof, woof, woof-woof"

194
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,738
Stop it!

195
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:21,342
Don't yell. Please don't
scowl at me like that, Ryoko.

196
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:24,745
You've got no right to
talk to me like you know me!

197
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,680
What are you saying?

198
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,816
This is you and me.
We've even exchanged gifts.

199
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,419
You're the one who just
kept sending them to me!

200
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,989
Finding those flowers was tough, you know.

201
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:39,493
If you hadn't been talking to
your friends and said you wanted them,

202
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,395
I wouldn't have had to go to such trouble.

203
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:42,563
What?

204
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:47,368
And that doll, and those insects,
and that lovely dress...

205
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:52,540
Oh, yes, and that dead hamster
I sent you on your birthday.

206
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,874
What are you talking about?

207
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,677
Love is about devoting yourself, isn't it?

208
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:59,874
I really came to understand
that with this relationship.

209
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:03,984
So why?

210
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,853
I love you so much!

211
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,022
What are you unhappy with?!

212
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:11,058
No! Why?! Why are you doing this?!

213
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:15,362
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't
have had to suffer like this!

214
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,031
What did you say?

215
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,399
What's there to suffer?!

216
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,501
What part of my love is making you suffer?!

217
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:22,203
Just stop it!

218
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:26,674
Ryoko, what part of it
is making you suffer?!

219
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,973
...you, too, will go to Hell.

220
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,982
I'm going to ask you one last time, Ryoko.

221
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:38,452
What part of me is making you suffer?!
Well?! What is it?!

222
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,422
-Answer me, Ryoko!
-Nooo!

223
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:42,823
...to Hell.

224
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,723
Ryoko!

225
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:52,867
Your grievance has been heard.

226
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,664
Hey, what are you doing in there?!

227
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,604
Hey, hold it!

228
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,776
It's gone! The doll's gone?!

229
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,710
Are you all right, Ryoko?

230
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,149
The covenant has been established.

231
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,117
Look down at your chest.

232
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,715
It's the seal of the covenant.

233
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:22,485
The seal...of the covenant?

234
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:58,529
Ai, I'll leave your under-kimono here.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,730
Thank you, Grandma.

236
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:55,679
Dad...

237
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:02,963
I won't forgive you. You betrayed me.

238
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,658
I'll make you regret it!

239
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:10,831
Welcome.

240
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,874
Damn! Lights-out time, huh?

241
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,082
Wha?!

242
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,033
Is something the matter?

243
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,541
Oh, you can't do this with the water.

244
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,066
You shouldn't leave it running.

245
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:00,377
"Youji Takamura"

246
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,183
Wh-Wh-What's going on?!

247
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:09,963
I'm so sorry.

248
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:13,100
-Dad!
-Dear!

249
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,568
No! Dear!

250
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,123
So he's dead.

251
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:38,358
Serves him right.

252
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:42,796
I'll send you right after
your father, Ryoko.

253
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,696
It's what you get for betraying me.

254
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:52,005
Bastard!

255
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:56,704
How dare you make my daughter
suffer like that?!

256
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,306
Why you! Take that! And that!

257
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:11,625
Well? Has it gotten
through to you a little?

258
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,462
She means, do you feel like
repenting for what you did?

259
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:16,864
Captain Kisaragi.

260
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,832
Wh-What are you talking about?

261
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,968
I haven't done anything wrong.

262
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,636
Oh-ho, is that so?

263
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:24,304
It's Ryoko's fault!

264
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:26,073
It's her fault for betraying me!

265
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,976
It's all her fault!

266
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:31,069
Hear that, Miss?

267
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:43,757
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

268
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:46,593
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

269
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:49,221
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

270
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,362
Care to give death a try?

271
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:14,012
Wh-Wh-Where am I?

272
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,565
W-Wait! Where are we going?!
Wh-Where in the world are we?!

273
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:27,401
Where are we, I wonder? Eh, Mister?

274
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,837
Wh-What are you doing?! Let me go!

275
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,397
No can do.

276
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:54,428
I consign this grievance to Hell...

277
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:59,566
"Little lost, little lost kitty cat"

278
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:04,469
"Where is your home?"

279
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:08,976
See you later!

280
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,077
Later! Bye!

281
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:11,078
Wanna drop by somewhere?

282
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:13,478
Yeah, let's.

283
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,851
Okay, as punishment,
the unsociable Ryoko

284
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:21,421
must go explore the
haunted apartment building alone!

285
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:23,223
What?! No way! I'm not going!

286
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:24,391
Then, you can take us out to eat.

287
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,759
I don't like that, either!

288
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,353
-Picky, picky!
-Hah-hah!

289
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,398
Well, I'll see you tomorrow!

290
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,432
Okay, see you tomorrow!

291
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:33,667
-Bye-bye!
-You owe us!

292
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,861
Oh, please!

293
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:38,238
You're late!

294
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,573
Sorry about that.

295
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:42,910
To make up for it, we'll go eat
wherever you want to today, Ryoko.

296
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,811
Hey, that's a great idea, Dear.

297
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:51,785
Hell...

298
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:52,085

He was my senior and a shining beacon.

315
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,055
I thought he was a great person, but...

316
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:47,292
I never imagined he would secretly
do something like that so callously.
