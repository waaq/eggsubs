1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,890
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,630
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,170
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,900
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,270
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,080
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,210
Kimi to kami o kiru kagami no naka

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,620
Jugyou-chuu no rouka hibiku ashioto

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,890
Taezu ame no oto ga tsuite-kuru yo

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:52,670
Kanjiru mama no katachi wa mabushii
amai hana ni naru

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,370
Doku no mi ni mo naru

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,110
Kyou mo ame

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,350
Ano hi to ima o
sora to sora de tsunagitai no

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,980
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,990
Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,760
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:26,600
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,270
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:37,410
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,050
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,320
Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

23
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,760
Sentaro...

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,040
Tsugumi, what's wrong?

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, no, it's nothing.

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,170
I'd like these.

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,170
"Rain of Remorse"

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,830
Man, sorry about last night.

29
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,630
I didn't have time to call...

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,790
...and I ended up drinking
until morning.

31
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,950
There's...no breakfast, right?

32
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,280
Then, we can go downstairs...

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,760
Thanks for the food.

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,130
Go like you're supposed
to this year, okay?

35
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,790
What're you talking about?

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,300
Never mind!

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll go by myself!

38
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,450
"Ogawa"

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,090
Coming!

40
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,570
Welcome, Tsugumi!

41
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,230
We've been waiting for you.

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,200
Is Hajime...

43
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,950
Tsugumi bought this?

44
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,990
A photographic collection?

45
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,500
Something this expensive...

46
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,860
"Japan's Cherry Blossoms"

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,860
"Photographed at Mutsumi Village"

48
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,750
A-Ai, you have another message.

49
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,870
Moody, isn't she?

50
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,310
Doesn't it sort of make
you feel uneasy?

51
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,540
It makes me realize...

52
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,510
I guess it's already been
that long since Ayumi died.

53
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,980
Yes, it has.

54
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,910
After all, Tsugumi was so
little back then, but now...

55
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,180
Look. She made this beautiful
dish of rice with chestnuts.

56
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,260
Isn't today the anniversary
of your wife's death?

57
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,160
The wife I split up with.

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,790
But why are you asking that?

59
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,560
Tsugumi came by yesterday,

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,670
asking about how to make
rice with chestnuts.

61
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,940
Because it was her
mother's favorite dish.

62
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,970
I didn't know...

63
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,670
You guys knew each other since
you were students, right?

64
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,670
And you even had a kid...

65
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,940
It was one of those so-called
youthful indiscretions.

66
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,050
The report on the faculty meeting
is the next issue's special feature!

67
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,290
Who the hell backs down without a fight
just because you got turned away?!

68
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,790
I heard Shibata got shot down.

69
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,090
-Hey, you sure you guys
aren't getting soft?!

70
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,800
-So that's why he's so pissy.
-Hey, you sure you guys
aren't getting soft?!

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
So who shot him down?
What's she like?

72
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
-Miss Ogawa,
-A journalist takes a stand for
the reader's right to know!

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,170
-A quiet girl who used to be the same...
-A journalist takes a stand for
the reader's right to know!

74
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,000
...language class until last year.
-A journalist takes a stand for
the reader's right to know!

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,990
Do you get that?!

76
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,510
M-Miss Ayumi Ogawa,
please go out with me!

77
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,580
Her personality is the total
opposite of Shibata,

78
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,150
but it was love at first
sight for Shibata...

79
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,280
...and he expressed the feelings he's
had these past two years today, but...

80
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,930
If you've got time for idle
chitchat, go check the copy!

81
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,340
You better keep me company
until morning tonight.

82
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,310
We know.

83
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,640
Shibata...

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,810
Yes!

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
About what happened earlier...

86
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,200
Yes!

87
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,530
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,400
Not at all.

89
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,570
I mean, being confronted like that
so suddenly in front of everyone...

90
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,540
I'm sorry!

91
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,740
I hadn't thought about that.

92
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,050
I'll never show my face
around you again. I promise.

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, um, that's not it.

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,850
What?

95
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,630
That is...if you would have me...

96
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,210
Of course! It's totally okay!

97
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,790
I never expected Shibata would be
the first of us to get married.

98
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,420
Surprising...but I guess, not really.

99
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,420
He fell head over heels for Ayumi,
after all.

100
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,870
Hello?

101
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,200
What? Really?

102
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,640
Has something happened?

103
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,540
The Tokyo Public Prosecutors
went in...

104
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,550
...to former Prime Minister
Takenoshita's private residence.

105
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,270
It looks like this
is going to be big.

106
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,020
I'll go, too.

107
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,010
Sorry!

108
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,290
Maybe that was the first
stroke of bad luck for us...

109
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,010
Noriko Hayashi.

110
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,980
"Central Hotel 7"

111
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,730
Central Hotel 7...

112
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,700
Tsugumi? Tsugumi?

113
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,130
Are you okay, Tsugumi?

114
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,340
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.

115
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,140
But you look pale.

116
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,200
Maybe we should go take
a little break.

117
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,710
Hell Girl's notified me again.

118
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,690
This time, I know both
the place and the name.

119
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,210
"Cafe New Deen"

120
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,200
If I tell Hajime, he's sure
to get in Hell Girl's way.

121
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,900
"Address List / Hajime /
Grandpa / Grandma / Yuko"
If I tell Hajime, he's sure
to get in Hell Girl's way.

122
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,000
"Address List / Hajime /
Grandpa / Grandma / Yuko"
But...

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
"Address List / Hajime /
Grandpa / Grandma / Yuko"
Maybe he'll understand that
Hell Girl is doing the right thing.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Maybe he'll understand that
Hell Girl is doing the right thing.

125
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,010
Are you not feeling well, after all?

126
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,610
What?

127
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,980
You don't seem to have much
of an appetite, either.

128
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,250
Oh, th-that's not true.

129
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,160
Tsugumi?

130
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm going to go make a call.

131
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,330
"Answer
...Tsugumi"

132
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,100
It's Tsugumi.

133
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,710
You'd better apologize properly.

134
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,910
It's never quite
as easy as that...

135
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,240
Hello?

136
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,380
Noriko Hayashi.
Central Hotel 7.

137
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,540
What?

138
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,340
Was it Hell Girl, Tsugumi?

139
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,660
H-Hey!

140
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,990
Put it on my tab!

141
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,930
So anyway, Noriko's bored
of the current condo.

142
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,000
And it doesn't have a good view, either.

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,840
All right, all right. I'll buy you one.

144
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,510
Honestly, you sure are spoiled, woman.

145
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,840
But that's because I can
always depend on you, Keiichi.

146
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,580
Central Hotel 7?

147
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,220
Please hurry!
It's an emergency!

148
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,590
Sure, sure.

149
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,720
But you know,
my motto is safe driving.

150
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,230
The fastest you can manage is fine.

151
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,720
Sure, sure.

152
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,060
"Central Hotel 7"

153
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, dear, we're stuck
in a traffic jam. See?

154
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,050
Are you with the media?

155
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,550
Something like that.

156
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,320
I knew it.

157
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,960
I've only been driving
a taxi for half a year,

158
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,860
but I can always spot
the media people.

159
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,190
Is that right?

160
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,160
Charging around late at night
and early in the morning.

161
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,100
No time to pay
attention to family.

162
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,870
That's the kind of vibe
they give off.

163
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,200
I bet you've got some
troubles at home, too, right?

164
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,470
Hello?

165
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,980
I understand. I'll be right there.

166
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,750
You're going out?

167
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,860
There's apparently been an
accident at some power plant.

168
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,460
I'll call you when
I know what's going on.

169
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,830
Oh, you can stay in bed.

170
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,990
Look after the house
while I'm gone.

171
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,920
"I'll be back by 7.
I'll call."

172
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,120
When she's born...

173
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,110
Maybe things will change a little...

174
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,060
Even after Tsugumi was born,
Hajime didn't change, did he?

175
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,960
Not only that,
but now that he had a child,

176
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,330
he threw himself into his
work even more than before.

177
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,270
I wonder how Ayumi must have felt...

178
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

179
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,680
What's wrong?

180
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,010
I-It's nothing.

181
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,480
Then, shall we go?

182
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,620
Central Hotel 7.

183
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,610
Oh, that's it there.

184
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,720
Are you going to stake it out?

185
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,050
I don't know.

186
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,990
That day...

187
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,160
As usual, I hadn't returned
home in days,

188
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,130
continuing a stakeout...

189
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,840
It was because it was rumored that a
politician popular for his integrity...

190
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,810
...was having a torrid affair.

191
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,140
But...

192
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,390
H-Hold on, Shibata!
What's wrong?!

193
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,330
Please let me go, Mr. Murai!

194
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,760
Hey, wait, Shibata!

195
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,740
Who're you?

196
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,380
You bastard!

197
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,080
You bastard! You bastard!
You bastard! You bastard!

198
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,420
Stop this, Shibata! Hey, quit it!

199
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,190
The wife of the man pursuing a story
about an extramarital affair...

200
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,460
...turned out to be having
an affair herself.

201
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,430
It wasn't even funny.

202
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,290
Oh, Sir, your receipt!

203
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,870

204
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,440

Noriko!

205
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,960
Noriko!

206
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,970
Don't do it!

207
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,480
Your grievance has been heard.

208
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,820
"Central Hotel 7"
Your grievance has been heard.

209
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,510
"Central Hotel 7"

210
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,580
Ai, I'll leave your
under-kimono here.

211
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,310
Do you know what
it is that you've done?!

212
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,850
You've sent a person to Hell!

213
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,580
I loved her...

214
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,350
But to her, I was nothing but...

215
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,150
No, all men were nothing
but deep pockets to her.

216
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,850
How could I forgive
a woman like that?!

217
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,890
How could I forgive her?!

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,230
While I was working,

219
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,830
she was fooling around
with other men!

220
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,040
You saw her, too, Mr. Murai!

221
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,370
Not to mention leaving Tsugumi
alone while she was out!

222
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,780
But think about Tsugumi.

223
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,110
She still needs a mother.

224
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,680
She does not need a mother
who is unfaithful!

225
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,320
Shibata...

226
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
I'm the one suffering
the most here!

227
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,350
She's been the only one
for me since college!

228
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,790
If this was what she was
going to put me through...

229
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,330
I wish I'd never met her.

230
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,830
So I wanted her
to be gone for good...

231
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,830
That it served her right
to go to Hell...

232
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,610
What is this? What's going on?!

233
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,120
H-Hey, you there!

234
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
You called?

235
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,020
My friend just suddenly...

236
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,260
...turn into money or something?

237
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,690
What?

238
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,160
How splendid for you.

239
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,600
To you, men are...

240
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
...money, right?

241
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,730
Nooo!

242
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,880
You there! Please help me!

243
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,850
Money, is it?

244
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,320
If 5 yen will do...

245
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,960
What is this?!
What's going on?!

246
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,460
What a stupid thing to do...

247
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,660
What do you know?

248
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,810
Hajime...

249
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,780
What're you doing here?

250
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,890
I want to start over.

251
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,820
How can I trust someone who's
already betrayed me once?!

252
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
Is there no way?

253
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,830
No.

254
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,160
And I have no intention of
letting you see Tsugumi, either.

255
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,070
Go on.

256
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,730
Don't show up around here again.

257
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,900
It can't be...

258
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,710
It can't be...

259
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,650
Nooo!

260
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,180
This way. Over here.

261
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,360
This is...

262
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,020
A place that has your beloved money.

263
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,370
However, you'll never
be getting out of here.

264
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,370
Beware of fires...

265
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,020
Nooo!

266
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,350
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

267
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,420
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

268
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,090
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

269
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,870
Care to give death a try?

270
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,860
Nooo!

271
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,380
Men are just...

272
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,750
They're the ones that
flock to me.

273
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,340
So why does this have
to happen to me?

274
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,450
No one will flock to you now.

275
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,570
I consign this grievance to Hell...

276
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,760
Nooo!

277
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,120
Hatred will only make
you feel empty...

278
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,790
That's why revenge...

279
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,260
...is something you
must never take!

280
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,290
To say nothing of exacting
revenge at someone's request,

281
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,920
which is something that
should never be condoned.
