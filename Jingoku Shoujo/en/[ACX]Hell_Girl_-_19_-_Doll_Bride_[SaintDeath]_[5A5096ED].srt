1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:03,192
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,827
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:06,963
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,565
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:14,103
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,839
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

8
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:29,048
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

9
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:34,219
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

10
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,591
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

11
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:44,863
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

12
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:52,638
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

13
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:55,341
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

14
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,077
Rain again today

15
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:05,317
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

16
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,953
In this craziness, uncertainty

17
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:15,928
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

18
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:18,731
In this craziness, you gave me life

19
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:26,572
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

20
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:29,241
In this craziness, uncertainty

21
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:37,349
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

22
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,019
In this craziness, you gave me life

23
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:48,256
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

24
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,726
You look splendid, Inori.

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,168
Just like a doll.

26
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:21,055
Why?

27
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:22,924
Why?!

28
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:27,959
"Bride Doll"

29
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,424
Why...

30
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,063
"Master Japanese Doll Maker
Kyougetsu Ujiie"

31
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,699
"Master Japanese Doll Maker
Kyougetsu Ujiie"
...didn't I notice it then?

32
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,266
...didn't I notice it then?

33
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:39,464
That strange glint in Mother's eyes...

34
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,272
Mother...

35
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,782
What are you doing at this hour?

36
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,418
I thought to feed the koi...

37
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:57,216
Leave such matters to the servants.

38
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:02,994
You need not undertake
any household chores.

39
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:03,983
Come.

40
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:08,132
I apologize.

41
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,101
It is getting rather chilly.

42
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,729
Take your bath first,
so you do not catch a cold.

43
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,330
Thank you very much.

44
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:30,143
M-Mother...

45
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:33,724
You have gained weight.

46
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:35,760
What? No!

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,751
No, you have gained weight.

48
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:44,902
I will not allow it.

49
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:47,305
You must never gain weight!

50
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:48,636
Come here!

51
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,038
Mother!

52
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,913
I'm sorry! Forgive me, Mother!

53
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,928
It seems the wind is picking up.

54
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,496
What an unpleasant wind.

55
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:15,659
Lukewarm and cold...

56
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,961
People cry on nights like this.

57
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,240
"Kyougetsu Ujiie"

58
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,550
Yukio...

59
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,658
What's the matter, Inori?

60
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,593
I...

61
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,721
Are you feeling better now?

62
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,757
Forgive me...

63
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,959
I'm so scared...

64
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm sorry for that.

65
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,563
It's not that Mother hates you.

66
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:24,068
I think she wants the Ujiie
bride to stay beautiful.

67
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,971
That's just how she is.

68
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:30,274
There's that important
exhibition coming up,

69
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,242
so she must be on edge.

70
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:42,687
Ugly!

71
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,279
How ugly!

72
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:52,463
I suppose mother is a great
doll maker of Japan.

73
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:55,900
You've married into
a difficult family.

74
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,203
Oh, no. But I have you.

75
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:02,773
Now, I have another early start
tomorrow, so let's turn in.

76
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,210
I've been rather tired lately.

77
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,014
Um, if you would just tell me when
you want a massage, I could do it.

78
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:13,584
I learned how to at the Kyougetsu Home,
so I'm very good at it.

79
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,220
Forget about the orphanage.

80
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,123
You don't have to do
such things anymore.

81
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,392
You're our precious bride now.

82
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,762
But I would like to be
allowed to do something, too.

83
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,964
Otherwise, even though I've
married into the family,

84
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:28,955
it's like I'm a guest here.

85
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:36,073
Then, let's have you
make breakfast tomorrow.

86
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,335
All right.

87
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,451
Yukio, breakfast is ready...

88
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:03,234
Inori, I believe
I told you this before.

89
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,237
That you need not undertake
any household chores.

90
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:07,838
I apologize.

91
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,641
Come, Inori, join us before
the food gets cold.

92
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,776
Oh, no.

93
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:15,479
A separate meal has been
prepared for Inori.

94
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,414
She's gained weight, just a little.

95
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,907
Come, have a seat.

96
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,424
Do you not hear me telling you
to have a seat?

97
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:27,914
F-Forgive me...

98
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,157
Straighten your spine properly.

99
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,436
That is how you should be.

100
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:42,306
The servants will take care
of your every need.

101
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:44,875
You will sit quietly.

102
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,878
Beautiful and graceful.

103
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:50,073
Like a doll.

104
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,390
Are you all right, Inori?

105
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:05,763
Yukio, help me! Please help me!

106
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:08,365
Just what is the matter, Inori?

107
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:11,702
I'm scared! I am scared out of my mind!

108
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:13,761
Of that look in Mother's eyes!

109
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:27,384
The mistress has ordered that
you are to cool your head.

110
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,254
That you are to empty your mind.

111
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:32,245
Empty my mind...

112
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,597
What do you think, Ms. Ujiie?

113
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,428
Shall we try dressing it?

114
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:45,569
No, not yet.

115
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,738
The eyes are not dead yet.

116
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:50,508
This cannot be called a dead doll.

117
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,669
A shroud could not possibly suit it!

118
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:59,013
What I desire is a doll filled
with sorrow and despair.

119
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:09,252
Ai, you got a message,
just like you expected.

120
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:15,087
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

121
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,971
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,840
I want to go back.

123
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,933
I want to see everybody!

124
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,279
Bye-bye!

125
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:39,790
Tsugumi!

126
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,121
Are you...Again?!

127
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,663
I can see! There's a girl crying.

128
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:47,698
I think she's about high school age.

129
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:50,360
She's pretty, like a doll.

130
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:57,667
Who's there?!

131
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,445
Hell Girl...

132
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,086
Doll...

133
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:15,459
No!

134
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:18,128
You look splendid, Inori.

135
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:21,432
Just like a doll.

136
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,834
You will sit quietly.

137
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,970
Like a doll.

138
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,304
No!

139
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:29,373
What are you afraid of?

140
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:30,774
I figured it out,

141
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:34,645
that she'd been watching
me for a long time.

142
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,448
Ever since I was a child...

143
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,850
You are quite adorable.

144
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,821
Come to my home when you've grown up.

145
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:45,923
Everyone was happy for me.

146
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:51,395
That an orphan like me was able to
marry into such a wonderful house.

147
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:55,633
So you hate this house, this woman.

148
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,701
I am not a doll.

149
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:00,804
I want to be a person!

150
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,106
I see.

151
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:05,743
If you really want retribution,

152
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:08,303
untie this red thread.

153
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,148
However,

154
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,983
once you have your retribution,

155
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,854
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

156
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:18,255
I know.

157
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:21,247
The Sister always said so, too.

158
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,647
Hey, are we still going
to stick around?

159
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,517
Someone is about to bring
misfortune on herself.

160
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,018
We can't just ignore that.

161
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:50,688
But it's what she
wants herself, right?

162
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:54,525
It's an adult's duty
to provide guidance even then.

163
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm not an adult,
so I don't understand it.

164
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,173
Hajime, that's her!

165
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,435
I'm sure of it.

166
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:24,388
What'll I do? I've come
outside without permission...

167
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:27,858
But you came outside,
because you wanted to run away...

168
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:28,847
Am I wrong?

169
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,131
Come on, let's hurry.

170
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:36,156
Won't it be bad to stay here?

171
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:47,671
"Kyougetsu Home"

172
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:53,117
Are you okay?
Have you stopped crying?

173
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,277
What?

174
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,221
Why...

175
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,656
How did you know that
I had been crying?

176
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:00,858
I don't know.

177
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:04,862
I don't know, but I've got this
ability to know things like that.

178
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:10,467
It looks like I sense it when someone
gets in contact with Hell Girl.

179
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:15,205
Do you want to send someone to Hell,
no matter what?

180
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:19,443
But in the end, if you curse someone,
you'll go to Hell, too.

181
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:22,846
I do not mind that I will
be bound for Hell.

182
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:26,509
But I can't let everyone at
the Kyougetsu Home suffer.

183
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,655
Kyougetsu Home...
You mean this place?

184
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,590
My home.

185
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,160
I grew up here.

186
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,964
When I was here, I couldn't
wait to get out into the world,

187
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,700
but now, I miss this place.

188
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,538
And the one who was supporting
this home of ours...

189
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,907
...was Ms. Kyougetsu Ujiie.

190
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:52,239
Or rather, it was Mother.

191
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:56,046
Everyone is very grateful.

192
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:59,616
They wish me the best in my marriage.

193
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:03,654
But you're having to endure something.

194
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:04,555
What happened?

195
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:04,988
"Emergency Exit"
What happened?

196
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,421
"Emergency Exit"

197
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:09,649
Nothing. I am permitted nothing.

198
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:14,198
I'm told to just behave like a doll.

199
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:16,530
What do you mean, like a doll?

200
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:23,574
At any rate, this doesn't seem like
a problem for you to solve alone.

201
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,338
I'd suggest that you have an honest
talk with the people at the Home.

202
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:30,514
I can't do that.

203
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:31,748
Why not?!

204
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:34,184
If you talk to them properly,
I'm sure they'll understand!

205
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,386
That's why I can't.

206
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,219
Everyone's sure to tell me...

207
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,626
If there is ever anything
you absolutely cannot bear,

208
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:44,995
come back at any time.

209
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:46,553
Do you understand?

210
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:53,203
The people here are all truly
kind and they care about me.

211
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,605
That's why I can't tell them!

212
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,876
If I don't suffer in silence,
this place will be shut down!

213
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:01,310
And that's why you called Hell Girl...

214
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,511
Emergency exits...

215
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:07,751
"Emergency Exit"

216
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,188
"Emergency Exit"
...are for anyone to use
in an emergency, right?

217
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,457
"Emergency Exit"
I think so...

218
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:17,257
"Emergency Exit"
To me, Hell Girl is my emergency exit!

219
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:24,334
Isn't there anything we could do?

220
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,030
You followed us,
because you wanted help, right?

221
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:46,390
That girl won't untie the thread.

222
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,892
She cares about the people
here above all else.

223
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,395
But is it okay for things
to be this way?

224
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,397
Sacrificing herself...

225
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:54,998
I feel sorry for her!

226
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:58,024
She'll probably keep suffering
from now on, too.

227
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,481
Ms. Ujiie, Inori is...

228
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:14,551
I see. You may leave for today.

229
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:15,711
Yes, Ma'am.

230
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,547
Where did you go out to?

231
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,783
I apologize. I went for a little walk.

232
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:48,618
Is that so? For a walk?

233
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,020
Forgive me.

234
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,124
It cannot be helped.
You have such mobile legs.

235
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,026
Unlike a doll.

236
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,186
What?!

237
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,032
If only those legs wouldn't move!

238
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:03,693
Like a doll.

239
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,744
You are supposed to be my doll!

240
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,313
Behave as I wish you to behave!

241
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:18,474
A doll has no need of a soul!

242
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:30,727
Those eyes...How wonderful they are.

243
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:35,532
Young and beautiful.
You are the very picture of a dead doll.

244
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:38,201
Man, oh, man. Women are scary.

245
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,533
You just figured that out now?

246
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:50,547
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:53,150
Please forgive me, Sister.

248
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,352
I can't pray anymore.

249
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,513
I can't do any more penitence, either.

250
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:04,326
Will you untie it?

251
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,398
It's her fault!

252
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:11,068
She treats me like a doll
instead of a person!

253
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,237
I can feel pain and anger, too!

254
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,728
I won't be her doll!

255
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:26,049
Inori, who are you talking to?
Yelling like that...

256
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,150
Yukio...

257
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,913
I'm so worried about you...

258
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,959
I do resent that woman.

259
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,951
-I will live my life with Yukio.
-Inori, are you all right?! Inori?!

260
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:50,771
Your grievance has been heard.

261
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:28,111
You sure have grown old.

262
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:32,415
There's no stopping the oncoming years,
Ms. Ujiie.

263
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:33,717
Wh-What?!

264
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:37,320
You envy dolls, don't you?

265
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,448
Dolls that remain eternally
beautiful and never age.

266
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,356
Impossible!

267
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:58,065
Aw, man, you're going
to come to a bad end.

268
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:07,684
Becoming obsessed with dolls
is up to you,

269
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:10,209
but people aren't dolls.

270
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,738
Compared to dolls,
humans are nothing!

271
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:32,309
Nothing but superficial,
ugly, depraved beings!

272
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,145
Dolls are my all!

273
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:39,082
And bringing them to life
or killing them...

274
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,618
...is up to me.

275
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,950
I am truly a god!

276
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,952
Good grief.
Time for the Miss's turn.

277
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:00,837
O pitiful shadow lost
in the darkness...

278
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:03,440
Demeaning and bringing
harm to others...

279
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,710
A damned soul,
wallowing in sin...

280
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,178
Care to give death a try?

281
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,634
You're beautiful.

282
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,102
Just like a doll.

283
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:40,510
I would like to make
a doll like you.

284
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,913
I imagine a shroud would
suit it quiet well.

285
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:47,017
I will let you make them for
eternity in the world beyond.

286
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:51,054
But your model will
be yourself dying.

287
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:55,047
Oh, how beautiful you are.

288
00:21:57,027 --> 00:22:01,464
I consign this grievance to Hell...

289
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:15,412
Yukio...

290
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:16,446
From now on,

291
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:20,417
I will devote myself to you to make
up for Mother's absence as well.

292
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,185
Body and soul...

293
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:23,209
Soul?

294
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:28,291
I don't need something like that.

295
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:33,997
All you have to do is watch me quietly.

296
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,988
Like a doll.

297
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:45,308
So in the end, she's a pitiful doll.

298
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:47,674
A living Hell.

299
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:59,356
"Inori Ujiie"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

300
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:00,352
"Inori Ujiie"

301
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:20,072
Always a dead end

302
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:26,745
There is no escape

303
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:34,854
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

304
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:39,120
And I'll let it fly

305
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:47,533
This place is ephemeral

306
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:58,511
An eternity that binds me

307
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:05,518
Coming or going

308
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:17,089
All that passes by are dreams

309
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:30,404
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

310
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,674
Your name?

311
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,243
Jill Due Lonfer.

312
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:38,179
The man who found
his way back from Hell.

313
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,714
You want to meet me?

314
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:41,883
Yeah, I do.

315
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:44,786
I can't imagine that you're
more powerful than I am,

316
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:48,990
but well, I have a bunch of
questions I want to ask you, too.

317
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,788
I don't.

318
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,458
Next time, "Hell Girl vs. Hell Boy".

319
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,094
"Hell Girl
Hell Girl vs. Hell Boy"
Next time, "Hell Girl vs. Hell Boy".

320
00:24:58,094 --> 00:25:00,594
"Hell Girl
Hell Girl vs. Hell Boy"
