1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:04,828
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:06,963
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,566
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,104
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:16,840
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are helpless
to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:29,019
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:34,191
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:39,563
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:44,834
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:52,609
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,312
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:58,048
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:05,288
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,924
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:15,899
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,702
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:26,543
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:29,212
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:37,320
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,990
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:48,227
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,860
All right, let's do this!

24
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,542
Hanagasa!

25
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:15,191
Those are scouts for the pros, right?

26
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,793
Yeah.

27
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:19,262
They're not the same people
who were here the other day.

28
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,431
That's what you'd expect
with the right arm in high school

29
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,830
that every pro team is watching.

30
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,562
But still...

31
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,572
I sure envy him.

32
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,911
Hanagasa!

33
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,742
Hanagasa!

34
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:42,073
"Tarnished Mound"

35
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,085
M-Muroi!

36
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,020
Y-You okay?

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,181
Y-Yeah...

38
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,661
You guys went to the
same middle school, right?

39
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,863
Uh, yes...

40
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,966
Then you know where Muroi lives, right?

41
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,768
Walk him home.

42
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:09,037
B-But...

43
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,373
Please, Iwashita.

44
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:13,102
O-Okay.

45
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,678
I'm sure you know already,

46
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:20,148
but you were messing around
and he fell from the embankment, got it?

47
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:21,750
What's that supposed to mean?!

48
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,851
I know.

49
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,551
Hey!

50
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,985
Please, Iwashita. Please...

51
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:32,288
Well, I'm counting on you.

52
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,636
I'm sorry, Iwashita.

53
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:46,574
I don't mind, but shouldn't
we tell a teacher the truth?

54
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,677
And what'll that get us?

55
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,712
If this became publicly known,

56
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,848
we'd be barred from
the tournament just for that.

57
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,784
I'm sure everyone else feels the same,

58
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,186
but I want to be in the tournament, too.

59
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:01,423
And if we're gonna do it,
I'd want to go to Nationals.

60
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:05,627
I hate to admit it, but to do that,
I guess we need him.

61
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:07,095
Exactly.

62
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:10,799
Well, I just have to grin and bear it,
and everything'll be fine.

63
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,535
But why did he hit you?

64
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,869
I dunno.

65
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:19,641
He's probably stressed out
from all the scrutiny.

66
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,409
What a disappointment.

67
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,146
"The right arm in high school
that every pro team is watching," my ass.

68
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,443
Now, now...

69
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,184
"Muroi"

70
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,520
-Owowow...
-My goodness...

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,190
Honestly, what happened?

72
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,258
Shoving him off an embankment?

73
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:40,128
We were messing around
and I just ended up pushing him...

74
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,565
You took it too far.
Really, be careful, okay?

75
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:45,931
I'm really sorry about this.

76
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,676
That was the last time I saw Muroi.

77
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:59,481
Muroi was absent from school
the next day and the day after that.

78
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,250
And the morning after that...

79
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,854
I have a sad announcement to make.

80
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:10,792
Kouichi Muroi of Year 1,
Class C has passed away.

81
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,861
I heard it was a ruptured internal organ!

82
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,362
What did he do?

83
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:17,132
Maybe someone punched him.

84
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:20,795
Let us have a minute of silence
in memory of Muroi.

85
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:34,215
What's this about?

86
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,618
Don't give me that "what's this about" line!

87
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,853
Muroi's dead!

88
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,255
So it seems.

89
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,289
Wha?!

90
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,950
It's your fault!

91
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,227
My fault?

92
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,196
You have some proof to back that up?

93
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,732
P-Proof?

94
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:52,300
There's nothing...

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,102
Of course, you don't.

96
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:57,806
Shouldn't you be worrying
about yourself instead?

97
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,434
Wha...I-Is this for real?

98
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,179
Hell Link?

99
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:07,382
Yeah, if you access the site at midnight...

100
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:12,187
...Hell Girl will come to
avenge your grievance!

101
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:15,088
That's scary! Stop it!

102
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,860
"Baseball"

103
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,225
"School Staff"

104
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,871
Iwashita!

105
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,872
Coach...

106
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,207
These are detectives.

107
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:35,743
They say they want to ask you
about Muroi's cause of death.

108
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,079
I-I...uh...

109
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,183
We were told you shoved him off
an embankment, but is that true?

110
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,352
The thing is, according
to the coroner's examination,

111
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:49,123
he could only sustain those injuries
if he were hit with a bat or something.

112
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,425
No...

113
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,160
Is that true, Iwashita?!

114
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,394
Oh, man!

115
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,930
If that's true, we can kiss
the tournament goodbye.

116
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,067
Y-You're wrong...I...

117
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,269
Murderer!

118
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,606
It's your fault!
It's your fault that Shinichi...

119
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:08,476
Do you know how much Shinichi suffered?

120
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:11,980
He was saying, "It hurts! It hurts!"
Right up until he died!

121
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,676
Writhing in his bed...

122
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,754
And yet, he...

123
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:24,158
He kept saying it wasn't your fault,
it wasn't your fault...

124
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:25,827
Why?

125
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:27,195
That's...

126
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:30,932
Give him back! Give Shinichi back!

127
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:33,301
Sister, calm down.

128
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,464
-Give him back!
-That's...That's...

129
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,497
...because he...

130
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,248
Muroi, I promise you.

131
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:50,240
If I make it to the pros,
I'll play extra hard in your memory.

132
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,456
Impressive.

133
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,583
Yeah. Admirable.

134
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,763
Hanagasa...

135
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,032
You bastard!

136
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,133
Dad?!

137
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,069
Listen to me!
Everyone's got the wrong idea about me...

138
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,593
You idiot!

139
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:16,477
I-I really do not know what I should say...

140
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:21,349
I know it was unforgivable,
but please...please...

141
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,185
Go home! Just go home!

142
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,286
We'll go home.

143
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,088
We'll go home for today,

144
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:29,886
but we will return at a later date
to offer our apology.

145
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,753
We are truly sorry!

146
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,032
An apology won't come cheap.

147
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:40,868
Tens of millions...
No, hundreds of millions...

148
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,137
N-No way...

149
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:45,840
What...should I do?

150
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,298
In any case...Please, believe me!

151
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,669
It wasn't me!

152
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:00,745
Anyway, let's go somewhere else and talk.

153
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,656
Hold it, Iwashita!

154
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,150
"Muroi"

155
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,043
"Matching Sites (1 out of
Hell Link
Your grievance shall be"

156
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,548
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

157
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,819
That rumor was true...

158
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:06,912
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

159
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:15,496
"Mamoru Hanagasa"

160
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:16,155
"Send"

161
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,031
"Send"

162
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,831
Do you not want to go?

163
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:53,790
It's okay, Grandma.

164
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,971
It can't be helped, after all.

165
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,737
You have no choice, but to do it.

166
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,282
What's with that site?

167
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,409
I haven't been able to get to it since...

168
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:20,294
H-How long have you been there?

169
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:22,029
You summoned me, remember?

170
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,332
I am Ai Emma.

171
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,933
Hell Girl?!

172
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,457
So it was true...

173
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,939
Take it.

174
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,634
O-Okay.

175
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:39,580
If you really want retribution,

176
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,251
untie that red thread.

177
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:48,723
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

178
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:52,960
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

179
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,529
O-Okay.

180
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,763
However,

181
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:57,832
Once you have your retribution,

182
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:01,702
you will have to pay the price
for it as well.

183
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,138
Curses come home to roost.

184
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:08,776
If you enter into the covenant,
you, too, will go to Hell.

185
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:11,540
Well, that's only after you die, though.

186
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,753
But no...

187
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,095
Even then...

188
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,096
Huh?

189
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,332
Wh-Where'd she go?

190
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:32,799
Was it a dream?

191
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,564
All that remains is for you to decide.

192
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:45,311
Okay, okay, okay!

193
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:53,120
They can't be in the tournament,
so why's the baseball team practicing?

194
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,123
But the official notice
hasn't come yet, right?

195
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,925
But talk about a bad break.

196
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,656
I've always thought this, but isn't
collective responsibility messed up?

197
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:06,667
I'm so sorry for you, Hanagasa.

198
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,501
I was looking forward to watching you
in the tournament.

199
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,702
You, there. Don't stand so far away.
Come over here.

200
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,848
What? That girl...

201
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,679
Huh? What is it?

202
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,842
No, it's nothing.

203
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:38,597
Okay, I'm here. Come on out.

204
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,464
Hanagasa...

205
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:52,313
Please, won't you take responsibility
for what you did?

206
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:55,483
It's too much for me to bear.

207
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:59,654
And? You thought I'd go, "Okay, I'll do it"?

208
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,455
If you won't say it...

209
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:05,293
If you don't, I have some ideas of my own...

210
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,561
Like tell them the truth?

211
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,031
But you already tried that last night.

212
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:14,435
Not that anyone seemed
to believe you, though.

213
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:19,006
Don't you think anything
of the fact that Muroi died?!

214
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,708
I do feel sorry for him.

215
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,411
But I never thought he'd wind up dead.

216
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,979
Talk about being too soft.

217
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,915
I guess he was never suited
for baseball to begin with.

218
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:28,749
That isn't funny!

219
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,652
Hold on. I don't care if you hit me,

220
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:35,323
but that'll be like
acknowledging your own guilt.

221
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:39,860
Also, don't think you'll
get away scot-free if you injure me.

222
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,997
If you hurt my dominant arm or something,
it'll be a huge deal.

223
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:46,767
Between that and reparations for Muroi,
your family would go bankrupt.

224
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,570
Wh-What am I supposed to do?

225
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,300
What happens to you isn't my problem.

226
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,576
Don't look at me like that.

227
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:58,846
I'm actually grateful to you and Muroi.

228
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:02,850
Thanks to you guys, I don't have
to participate in the tournament.

229
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,487
The team might've wanted to go
for the sake of a memorable youth,

230
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:10,558
but wearing out my shoulder
for something like that...

231
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:14,328
The scouts said it'd be better
if didn't have to play, too.

232
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:17,031
B-Bastard! Don't tell me it was on purpose?

233
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,522
And what are you going to do
if it was on purpose?

234
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,096
Are we done here?

235
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,540
Muroi...

236
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,242
Muroi...

237
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:31,178
Suffered...in pain...

238
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,346
He did?

239
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:33,914
Of course, he did!

240
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,041
Well, I didn't see him.

241
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,089
Are we done already?

242
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,557
We're done, right? Later.

243
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,764
But you'd better turn yourself in
to the police soon.

244
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:53,029
Or it'll make a bad impression
during your trial.

245
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:08,614
Your grievance has been heard.

246
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:16,789
Ai, I'll leave your under-kimono here.

247
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,692
Thank you, Grandma.

248
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:58,299
For our part, we plan to designate you
as our number one draft.

249
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,868
We intend to contract you
for at least a hundred million.

250
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,503
Thank you very much.

251
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:03,435
See you.

252
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,409
All right!

253
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:21,522
Hanagasa! Hanagasa!

254
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:27,194
Hanagasa! Hanagasa! Hanagasa!

255
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:30,898
Hanagasa! Hanagasa!

256
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:34,702
Hanagasa! Hanagasa! Hanagasa!

257
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:41,742
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

258
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:44,006
"Mamoru Hanagasa's Grave"

259
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:49,312
Wh-What's going on?!

260
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,487
What is this?!

261
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,079
Time out!

262
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,918
One more strike out
and you'll have a perfect game.

263
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,666
Hey, what is this?

264
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,934
Don't worry about it.

265
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:08,769
Is this a human...

266
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,465
Anyway, just one more strike out.

267
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:19,246
What's wrong? Don't you know
what a strike out is?

268
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:22,909
If that's the case, it means "to kill".

269
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:31,926
Muroi's out! Iwashita's out!
Muroi's out! Iwashita's out!

270
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:35,195
Hanagasa's out!

271
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,598
What kind of joke is this?

272
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,534
Up at bat is Iwashita.

273
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:41,933
Iwashita...

274
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:48,242
I get it. So this is your doing.

275
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,904
Give it up already!

276
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:57,649
Okay, that's the game.

277
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,424
What're you doing?!

278
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:04,758
It wasn't my fault.

279
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,794
I don't want to hear your excuses.

280
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,557
If you lose...

281
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:13,834
Enough with the practical jokes!

282
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,169
This is no practical joke.

283
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,005
Baseball is a serious
game of life and death.

284
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:20,708
Now, continue the game.

285
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,141
Damn it!

286
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,676
Like hell I'm letting you score!

287
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,184
Die!

288
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:37,415
Wha...

289
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:42,096
Safe!

290
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:45,224
My dominant arm!

291
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,170
Feel like acknowledging your guilt yet?

292
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,728
What did I do?!

293
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,512
You killed one and
framed another for it, remember?

294
00:19:58,512 --> 00:20:01,048
Don't you feel bad about
what you did to those two?

295
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:04,118
What happens to those guys
isn't my problem!

296
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:06,620
Just because you've got
some skill at baseball,

297
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,725
you think you're special
and you can get away with anything...

298
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:14,228
Talk about conceited.

299
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,664
Haven't you people read the papers?

300
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,299
My talent isn't just "some skill".

301
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,169
They say someone with my gift
only comes along once in a decade!

302
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:24,872
If I were to become
unable to play baseball,

303
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:28,575
what a loss it'd be for pro baseball
in Japan...no, the world.

304
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,811
Don't you get that?

305
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,746
You guys understand, right?

306
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:35,249
The same goes for Iwashita and Muroi, too.

307
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,818
You should be happy to die for my sake.

308
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:40,013
So he says, Miss.

309
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,658
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

310
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,695
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

311
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:50,289
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

312
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:53,457
Care to give death a try?

313
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,137
Wh-What now?!

314
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,872
Answer me!

315
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,929
I joined the team because
I wanted to play baseball, you know.

316
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,867
Sure, unlike you, it might
be impossible for me to go pro,

317
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:31,271
but I wanted to keep playing,
even if it was just amateur baseball.

318
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,507
But I can't play baseball anymore, can I?

319
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:36,877
If you want to play that badly,
go play on your own!

320
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:41,211
Really? Then let's play together, Hanagasa.

321
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:44,785
Play by yourself! Leave me out of it!

322
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:50,348
Oh? Don't you know? You can't
play baseball by yourself.

323
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:56,758
I consign this grievance to Hell...

324
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,310
-Morning!
-Morning!

325
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,947
They say "Youth A",
but it's totally obvious, you know?

326
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:17,251
If it's a baseball ace
that even the pros were watching...

327
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:20,754
Well, his face was all over
the newspapers and TV,

328
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:22,823
and that's why the witness was able to say

329
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:26,293
the guy hitting the junior players
with a bat was Hanagasa.

330
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,784
But I wonder where he disappeared to.

331
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,934
I've asked your aunt,

332
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:37,805
so if you run into any problems,
don't hesitate to call.

333
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:38,372
Okay.

334
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:39,039
"Muroi"
Okay.

335
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,028
"Muroi"

336
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,745
If you could come back home
once in a while...

337
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:47,047
When things settle down...

338
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,948
Though, I think that'll be a while.

339
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:55,289
"Daisuke Iwashita"

340
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,226
"Daisuke Iwashita"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

341
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:00,215
"Daisuke Iwashita"

342
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:20,205
Always a dead end

343
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:26,878
There is no escape

344
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:34,987
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

345
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:39,253
And I'll let it fly

346
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:47,666
This place is ephemeral

347
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:58,644
An eternity that binds me

348
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:05,651
Coming or going

349
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:17,222
All that passes by are dreams

350
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,297
"This is a work of fiction
and any similarities between
the names of characters or organizations
in this story and actual names
are entirely coincidental."

351
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:32,878
Your name?

352
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,513
Junko Kanno.

353
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,615
You were deceived?

354
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:39,451
I trusted that doctor.

355
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,853
Animals can't talk.

356
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:45,824
And knowing that,
he treated them like that.

357

00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,261
Your wish?

359
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:53,131

360
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:55,834
Your grievance has been heard.

361
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:56,668
"Hell Girl
Silent Cries"

362
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:59,705

Silent Cries"
Next time, "Silent Cries".

363
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:00,228

Silent Cries"
