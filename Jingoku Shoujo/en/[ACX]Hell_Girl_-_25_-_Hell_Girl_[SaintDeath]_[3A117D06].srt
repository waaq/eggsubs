1
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:03,192
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,861
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,996
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:09,599
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,137
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,873
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,081
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

9
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:34,253
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

10
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:39,625
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,897
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

12
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:52,671
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

13
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,374
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

14
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:58,110
Rain again today

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,351
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

16
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,987
In this craziness, uncertainty

17
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:15,961
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

18
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,764
In this craziness, you gave me life

19
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:26,605
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

20
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,274
In this craziness, uncertainty

21
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:37,383
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

22
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,052
In this craziness, you gave me life

23
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:48,289
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,663
I will not be killed!

25
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:56,994
Be gone!

26
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,175
You can't, Miss!

27
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,543
Stop this!

28
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:11,112
You mustn't kill at
the behest of your emotions!

29
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:14,449
You will be banished to Hell!

30
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,985
Even so, I do not care!

31
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:20,819
This is bad. Her heart is
completely ruled by hatred!

32
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,066
Miss!

33
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,710
-Miss!
-Miss!

34
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,923
I do not care.

35
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:58,017
So be it!
Consign this grievance to Hell!

36
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,534
Miss...

37
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,578
This can't be...

38
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,784
Miss!

39
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:36,423
"Hell Girl"

40
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:45,131
Hajime, I can't breathe...

41
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,793
Tsugumi... Tsugumi...

42
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,594
You awake, Sentaro?

43
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,339
I made some rice balls. Eat.

44
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,670
Right.

45
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,577
Straw sandals?

46
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,312
Yeah.

47
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,781
You're making them for everyone again?

48
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,217
You don't have to do that, Pa.

49
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:38,451
It's fine.

50
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:41,287
Then at least get paid
a little for them!

51
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:42,489
It's fine. Just eat.

52
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,757
Pa!

53
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:45,392
My body's weak.

54
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,828
I'm always a burden
on the village working the fields.

55
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,490
This is like an apology for that.

56
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,298
Eat.

57
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,442
When I'm done, I'll help you.

58
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,644
Never mind that. Go play.

59
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,279
Ai came by earlier.

60
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,480
What?

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,917
You were sleeping,
so she said she'd come later.

62
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:14,087
I don't have to today.
I'll make straw sandals.

63
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,989
Go play with her.

64
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:20,226
You're her cousin and you're about
the only one who'll play with her.

65
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:22,562
But...

66
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:23,696
Huh?

67
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,027
Ai!

68
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,669
What's wrong?!
Did you get bullied again?!

69
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,605
Who was it?! Koukichi?!

70
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:33,606
That bastard!

71
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,267
Sentaro, hold on!

72
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,972
Come back, Sentaro!

73
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,907
That idiot...

74
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,420
Koukichi!

75
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,055
What was that for, Sentaro?!

76
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,291
Shut up! You made Ai cry!

77
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,960
You idiot! She's an evil spirit!

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,795
Why are you bothering to defend her?!

79
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,797
You know it, too, don't you?!

80
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,600
Uncanny things happen when she's around!

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,668
Just yesterday,

82
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,804
she put a dead butterfly on her hand
and it came back to life!

83
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:07,040
It's her power as an evil spirit!
No question about it!

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,274
Shut up!

85
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,810
Everyone in the village
is uneasy about her, too.

86
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,911
They say if Ai stays here,

87
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:15,115
the village is sure to suffer
some terrible calamity someday.

88
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,283
So I told her to go away!

89
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,319
Told her to disappear for
the sake of the village!

90
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,620
What?!

91
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,110
Why you!

92
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,593
Anyone who defends Ai
isn't with the village!

93
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,660
Get him!

94
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,991
Yeah!

95
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:46,179
Sorry...

96
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:47,339
Nah...

97
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:52,719
That butterfly wasn't dead.
That was why...

98
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,711
Those bastards...
Don't pay them any mind.

99
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,725
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,098
Here.

101
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:14,407
I...

102
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:18,845
I don't think you're an evil spirit.

103
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,506
You're just Ai.

104
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:48,675
Tonight, your daughter will
be sacrificed to the mountain god...

105
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,077
...to insure abundant harvests
for the next seven years.

106
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:54,113
This is a great honor.

107
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:55,944
A great honor.

108
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,520
Everyone is waiting at the shrine.

109
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,249
Come when you're done preparing.

110
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:11,331
Why is it Ai?

111
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,466
Because Ai's an evil spirit...

112
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,301
Because everyone thinks that...

113
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,703
That's why, right?!

114
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,905
Sentaro...

115
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,273
Because she's uncanny!

116
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:21,808
Because you want her gone!

117
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:24,210
That's why you chose Ai
to be the Seven Sending maiden!

118
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,678
What?!

119
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:28,181
You all just want to kick Ai out!

120
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,983
Sentaro!

121
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,151
Then bring us a replacement!

122
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,142
Could you do that?

123
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,298
It's for the village.

124
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,823
I'll be waiting out front.
Hurry up now.

125
00:08:58,478 --> 00:08:59,809
Sentaro...

126
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,583
We want to ask you for a favor.

127
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:30,036
Now, go to the mountain god, cleansed.

128
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:47,019
Are you serious?

129
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:53,199
If we do that and the other
villagers find out...

130
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:55,635
Please help us do this.

131
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:56,669
What?

132
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,106
We know it's something we shouldn't do.

133
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,107
More than anything,

134
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:04,811
when I think that the mountain god
might bring his wrath down upon us...

135
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,245
But...

136
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,814
I'm begging you, Sentaro!

137
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,683
I'd feel wretched for Ai's sake
if we just let her go like this.

138
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:13,319
We beg of you! Protect Ai for us!

139
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,809
B-But...

140
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:18,123
Ai...

141
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:27,092
Hey, hurry it up!
I'm freezing out here!

142
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,104
All right.

143
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,698
I'll protect Ai!

144
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,947
It's still no good.

145
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:18,017
We don't have enough sunny days.

146
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,319
What's a man to do?

147
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,982
We'll just have to make a heartfelt
appeal to the mountain god.

148
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm sorry, but we'll be counting
on you again tonight.

149
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,731
Right.

150
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,155
It's me.

151
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,269
I brought you a change
of clothes and food.

152
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,793
Thank you...

153
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:44,036
This is awful...

154
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,973
Even if we scrape it all together,
it won't be enough for taxes.

155
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,441
What do we do, Pa?

156
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,142
We have no choice but
to have them settle...

157
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:52,512
...for the barnyard and foxtail
millet in the storehouse.

158
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:55,845
But that's what we're supposed to eat!
If we do that...

159
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,152
He's been like that all the time lately.

160
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,354
Must be hungry...

161
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:05,625
It can't be helped.
Not with his ma's milk not flowing.

162
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,193
Poor thing.

163
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:10,856
At that rate, he might not
make it through this winter.

164
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:21,807
"When will the cherry blossoms flower?"

165
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:27,346
"When will they flower
in the mountain village?"

166
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:33,920
"When will the cherry blossoms
grow fragrant?"

167
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,358
"When the laughing child
of seven plays"

168
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:45,932
"When will the cherry blossoms
dance about?"

169
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:51,537
"When the singing child
of seven goes to sleep"

170
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:58,244
"When will the cherry blossoms
wilt away?"

171
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:04,240
"When the dead child of seven ascends"

172
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,795
That scared me.

173
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,057
I know.

174
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,237
Sentaro?

175
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,380
Is it safe to leave the shrine
on a moonlit night like this?

176
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,715
I-It's fine.

177
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:38,918
The villagers are all distracted
by the state of the rice paddies.

178
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,886
I see...

179
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,547
Does it feel good?

180
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,321
Yes.

181
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:50,630
The moon is so beautiful.

182
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,961
Yeah.

183
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,295
If only...

184
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,307
If only things could
stay this way forever.

185
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,638
Ai...

186
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,155
Why don't we leave
the village together?

187
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,923
What?

188
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,915
Nah, it's nothing. Really...

189
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,789
You're strange...

190
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,734
Sentaro, what have you done?!

191
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:34,206
How...

192
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:36,375
There was a rumor going around...

193
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,046
That you were going into
the mountains every night.

194
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:41,681
Now we know.

195
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,249
The reason our rice crops
are suffering...

196
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,918
...is because she
defied the ritual!

197
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,320
You brought down the wrath
of the mountain god on us!

198
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,725
Did you ever think about how
our village is starving?!

199
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:56,762
Ai... What a girl you are!
It's unforgivable!

200
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:59,598
-Run, Ai! Run away!
-You're not getting away!

201
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,589
-Why you!
-Move!

202
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,471
Stop it!

203
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,605
Let me go!

204
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,374
Pa, let me go!

205
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:09,809
Catch her!

206
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,470
Don't let her escape!

207
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,602
Stop it!

208
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,256
Help me, Sentaro!

209
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,057
Sentaro-!

210
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,192
Shut up!

211
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,660
Ai!

212
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,662
No...

213
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,755
Nooo!

214
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,470
It makes me hate myself...

215
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,672
I want to help the Miss,

216
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:42,908
but the crucial moment comes
and I can't do a thing for her.

217
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,177
If the Miss hadn't taken us in,

218
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:49,582
we'd have ended up
rotting away in Hell.

219
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:52,651
We owe the Miss an enormous debt...

220
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,187
Where could she have gone?

221
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:58,791
Don't tell me she's really been
banished to Hell.

222
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,160
Now, calm down.

223
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,095
Panicking won't help anything.

224
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:06,587
It's the way of things
to turn out as they will.

225
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:15,107
-Let go! Let me go, Pa!

226
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,208
-Don't go! Don't you go! Stay here!
-Let go! Let me go, Pa!

227
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,144
-Don't go! Don't you go! Stay here!
-At this rate, Ai will... Ai will...

228
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,912
-Listen to me!
-At this rate, Ai will... Ai will...

229
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:22,481
Listen, Sentaro!

230
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:26,085
You were helping to violate
the village's ritual, too!

231
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,787
Do you want to die?!

232
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,822
If you do something again,

233
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:32,291
you won't be the only one
to pay the price!

234
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,692
Pa...

235
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:36,996
This was something Ai
once accepted, too.

236
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:38,964
But that was...

237
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:41,767
We have no choice but to do this.

238
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,904
If we are to beg
the mountain god for forgiveness,

239
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:46,772
we have to do this.

240
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,707
It's for the sake of the village.
Bear with it.

241
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,741
Don't...

242
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,209
Please, don't do this!

243
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,228
Ai...

244
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,559
Ai!

245
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:15,634
Sentaro...

246
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:16,794
Ai!

247
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:30,282
Come on, hurry up and finish it!

248
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:31,483
Hurry up and do it!

249
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:34,286
Hey, Sentaro!

250
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:39,158
Sentaro, you have deceived
the mountain god these past six years.

251
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,960
Atone for that sin.

252
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,796
If you do not beg forgiveness,
this will be for nothing.

253
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,264
I don't want to...

254
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:49,598
It's for the village! At this rate,
everyone's going to starve to death!

255
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,373
I'm hungry...

256
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,941
At least, if next year...

257
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,875
Please, Sentaro!

258
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,248
Sentaro!

259
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,484
It's because of you and Ai that
the village is suffering like this!

260
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,152
Hurry up and beg for forgiveness!

261
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:11,156
If my milk won't start flowing again,
he won't last much longer...

262
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:12,992
Sentaro...

263
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,653
Do it for the village!

264
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:17,893
Do it.

265
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:35,247
You said you would protect me...

266
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:37,238
I trusted you...

267
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,553
I trusted you!

268
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,289
Move aside!

269
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,190
Come on, bury them!

270
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,350
Yeah!

271
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,663
Sentaro...

272
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,339
Great mountain god,

273
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,842
the girl that violated
the ritual has been dealt with!

274
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,744
So please...

275
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:08,178
So please save the village!

276
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:12,952
I will curse you!

277
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,613
All of you!

278
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:19,484
Even from beyond the grave,
I will curse you!

279
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,665
A fire?

280
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:21,920
"When will the cherry blossoms flower?"

281
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,123
"When will they flower
in the mountain village?"

282
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:25,457
Ai?!
"When will they flower
in the mountain village?"

283
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,659
"When will they flower
in the mountain village?"

284
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:34,333
"When will the cherry blossoms
grow fragrant?"

285
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:40,039
"When the laughing child
of seven plays"

286
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,745
"When will the cherry blossoms
dance about?"

287
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,009
"When the singing child of seven..."

288
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,623
You saw that?

289
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:32,954
Yeah.

290
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:39,565
I don't understand...

291
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:42,591
I don't understand Sentaro...

292
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:46,071
I do.

293
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:47,806
What?

294
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,797
I understand.

295
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:20,064
Always a dead end

296
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:26,737
There is no escape

297
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:34,845
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

298
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:39,111
And I'll let it fly

299
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:47,524
This place is ephemeral

300
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:58,502
An eternity that binds me

301
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:05,509
Coming or going

302
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:17,080
All that passes by are dreams

303
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,397
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

304
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:35,102
If you really want retribution,

305
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:38,639
untie that red thread.

306
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,040
However,

307
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,975
once you have your retribution,

308
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:46,546
you will have to pay the price
for it as well.

309
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:50,917
Curses come home to roost.

310
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,620
You know all that already, don't you?

311
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,385
Now, all that remains
is for you to decide.

312
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:58,121
"Hell Girl
The Ephemeral"
Now, all that remains
is for you to decide.

313
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,456
"Hell Girl
The Ephemeral"
Tsugumi...

314
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,956
"Hell Girl
The Ephemeral"
