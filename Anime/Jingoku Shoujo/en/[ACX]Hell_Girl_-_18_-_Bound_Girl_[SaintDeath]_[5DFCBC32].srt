1
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:04,761
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:06,897
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:09,499
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:14,037
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:16,773
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,952
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

8
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:34,124
Kimi to kami o kiru kagami no naka

9
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:39,496
Jugyou-chuu no rouka hibiku ashioto

10
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:44,768
Taezu ame no oto ga tsuite-kuru yo

11
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:52,642
Kanjiru mama no katachi wa mabushii
amai hana ni naru

12
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:55,245
Doku no mi ni mo naru

13
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,981
Kyou mo ame

14
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:05,188
Ano hi to ima o

15
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,857
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:15,865
Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

17
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:18,635
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:26,476
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

19
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:29,145
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:37,287
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

21
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:39,923
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:48,262
Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

23
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:11,217
"Simono"

24
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,284
"Simono"
You're late!

25
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,286
"Simono"
Are you trying to starve me to death?!

26
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:16,914
"Simono"
I'm sorry! I'll make your
breakfast right away!

27
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:24,096
This tastes bad. Make it over again.

28
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:26,929
But I'll be late to school, so...

29
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,265
Don't you care what happens to them?!

30
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,107
Yukky! Pinky!

31
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:38,099
I could kill them at any time!

32
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:44,903
"Bound Girl"

33
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:56,548
I see that girl around a lot lately.

34
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,450
I wonder if she moved
into the neighborhood.

35
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,252
It's nothing like that!

36
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:03,983
I heard she lives in the
big condo next to the park.

37
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:08,994
She apparently goes to
Ms. Simono's place for tutoring

38
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:12,631
and the girl cooks for her
in return. Every day!

39
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,732
What?!

40
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:16,602
Is Ms. Simono even capable of tutoring?!

41
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,771
She hates children, doesn't she?

42
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:22,374
But she used to be a
school teacher, you know.

43
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:25,778
Though, she quit immediately when
she inherited her parents' fortune.

44
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,113
I wonder if her parents are aware of this.

45
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:28,447
"Curry"

46
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,816
"Curry"
They apparently came
to meet her once, but...

47
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:32,785
"Curry"
You know! Ms. Simono is nothing,
if not pleasant to outsiders.

48
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,119
You know! Ms. Simono is nothing,
if not pleasant to outsiders.

49
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,455
They probably fell right for it.

50
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,056
They both work and come home late,

51
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,959
so they probably think their
daughter's being looked after.

52
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,360
Yukky...Pinky...

53
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,369
Yukky...

54
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,878
Yukky!

55
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:01,079
Yukky!!

56
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,515
-Your teacher from school came by earlier.
-Open your eyes, Yukky!

57
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:07,486
-Yukky!
-I ignored him, of course.

58
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,788
You talked, didn't you?

59
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,890
I haven't said anything!

60
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,593
It's true! I really haven't
told anyone anything!

61
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:18,096
I told you what would happen
if you talked, didn't I?!

62
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:19,131
I really haven't said anythi...

63
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:22,328
I told you I could kill them
at any time, didn't I?!

64
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,947
I'm sorry, Yukky...

65
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:39,785
For not being able to make
you a proper grave...

66
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:42,254
Is my tea ready yet?

67
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,346
Coming!

68
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,695
One!

69
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:52,598
Two!

70
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,233
Three!

71
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:54,967
-I-I'll be right there!
-Four!

72
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,559
-I-I'll be right there!
-Four!

73
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,743
Oh, my glasses! My glasses!

74
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:06,745
But you wear contact lenses!

75
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:07,713
Oh, there it is.

76
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:10,282
-These comedians are funny!
-Right on you.

77
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,250
Why the heck?!

78
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,752
Why you!

79
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:15,187
And now, for an SM!

80
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:16,518
That's CM!

81
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:23,462
Um...

82
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:24,563
Huh? What?!

83
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,933
Oh, uh, um, it's already time...

84
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,800
What?

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,003
Oh, is it that late already?

86
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,404
Y-Yes.

87
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:34,706
You make sure you study
when you get home!

88
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:37,809
I'm supposed to be your tutor,
after all!

89
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:42,314
-Pinky...
-I'm the one who'll come under
suspicion if your grades get worse!

90
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:43,181
Do you understand?!

91
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,672
Oh, y-yes!

92
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,789
Pinky...

93
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:10,971
I'm home.

94
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,317
Yukky...

95
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,662
If only I hadn't let you go that time...

96
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,807
I'm sorry, Yukky!

97
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,672
I'm sorry!

98
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:57,022
I didn't think she'd really kill him...

99
00:06:57,022 --> 00:07:00,525
At this rate, someday, Pinky will also...

100
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:03,961
Someone! I don't care who!

101
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,296
Send her to Hell...

102
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:22,748
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

103
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,316
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"
I found it...

104
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,146
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

105
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:31,984
Yukky...

106
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,963
"Meiko Simono
Send"

107
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:41,333
"Meiko Simono
Send"
I'll get revenge for you.

108
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,368
"Meiko Simono
Send"

109
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:45,836
"Send"

110
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:54,279
Miki, are you awake?

111
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,338
Mom!

112
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,151
Where's your dad?

113
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,852
He said he's going to be gone overnight.

114
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:02,888
Oh, that's right.

115
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:06,458
I still haven't found Yukky and Pinky.

116
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,959
You haven't?

117
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,829
Why don't you give up already?

118
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,128
I'm going to look
for them a little more.

119
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,012
Hajime, breakfast is ready,
so make sure you eat it, okay?!

120
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,580
Sure!

121
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,309
See you later!

122
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:42,594
I am Ai Enma.

123
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,994
Hell Girl?

124
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,801
Take it.

125
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:54,372
If you really want retribution,

126
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,741
-untie that red thread.
-Tsugumi!

127
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,209
-Untie that red thread.
-Hey, Tsugumi!

128
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,836
Hey!

129
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:02,047
You saw something again,
didn't you, Tsugumi?!

130
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,082
She was giving someone the straw doll!

131
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,218
Then it's happening again somewhere!

132
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:09,988
Tsugumi, did you see anything
that hinted at where it was?

133
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:13,788
Any distinctive buildings or store names?

134
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,263
Someone's about to be sent to Hell again!

135
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:19,564
So...

136
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,600
Do we absolutely have to stop it?

137
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,835
What?

138
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,403
Well?

139
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:26,471
Of course!

140
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:29,304
"Shibata Town"

141
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,311
What a truly easy to identify location.

142
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,649
So it's this house.

143
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,812
"Simono"

144
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,145
Simono...

145
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,342
Is that the mother?

146
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:13,852
"Yamada Shop"

147
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,353
"Yamada Shop"
Ms. Simono?

148
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,422
"Yamada Shop"
She lives alone there.

149
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:17,956
What?

150
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,758
She doesn't have any kids.

151
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,195
She inherited a sizable
fortune from her parents.

152
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:25,497
She doesn't even work
and stays cooped up at home.

153
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,632
Who knows what she does?

154
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:31,002
I think she used to date various men
when she was younger,

155
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:34,072
but I never heard that she got married.

156
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:36,374
I wonder if I got the wrong house.

157
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,343
Maybe he's talking about that girl.

158
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:41,246
The one that's supposed to be regularly
visiting Ms. Simono's lately.

159
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,081
Oh, her!

160
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,784
She used to walk her dogs a lot.

161
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,719
She comes from the condo by the park.

162
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:04,663
So that's the girl.

163
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:10,008
What's wrong, Pinky?
You seem down.

164
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,943
Is it because Yukky's gone?

165
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:15,614
You better not be thinking
about running away with it!

166
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,515
Whose fault do you think
this leg injury is?!

167
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:20,685
I'll never permit you to run away!

168
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:23,989
I can kill it at any time.

169
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,014
So can I!

170
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,694
I can do it at any time, too!

171
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:08,099
It's been 3 days since then.
No activity whatsoever.

172
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,302
I wonder what that girl's thinking.

173
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:13,371
Wanyuudou must be bored out of his mind.

174
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,907
That's not true.

175
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:20,776
She talks to me on a daily basis.

176
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,342
I could also do it...at any time!

177
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:40,465
Here. These are the results of
the investigation you requested.

178
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:44,035
That was quick. You're a great help.

179
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:48,173
Let's see...Miki Kamikawa.
First year in middle school.

180
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,976
No one around her has died
under suspicious circumstances

181
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:54,746
or gone missing recently, huh?

182
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:57,816
Has she given up on revenge? Or...

183
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:59,517
There were dogs, though.

184
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:00,618
What?

185
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:01,453
Dogs?

186
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,978
Her dogs went missing.

187
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:10,929
Ever since she moved here,

188
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,990
walking her dogs in the morning
and in the evening was her daily routine.

189
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,674
She doesn't stand out in school

190
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:25,243
and she doesn't have
any close friends, either.

191
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:28,380
Her parents both work
and are often not at home.

192
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,010
Her two dogs were the only
ones she could open up to.

193
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,825
But two weeks ago,

194
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:43,461
the dogs went missing during their walk,

195
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:46,031
and that was the last time they were seen.

196
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:51,469
It was right around then that she
became a regular visitor here.

197
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:52,937
The two are related...

198
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:54,706
That's probably how I should look at this...

199
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:57,368
"Simono"

200
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:06,284
I told you, didn't I?!

201
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,653
That I'd kill your dog if
you snitched to anyone!

202
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:09,654
What?

203
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:12,257
A suspicious man has
been hanging around lately.

204
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:13,591
You snitched, didn't you?!

205
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,927
I don't know about that!
I don't know anyone like that!

206
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,496
It's your fault for not keeping
your end of the promise!

207
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,731
I'm going to kill it now!

208
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:22,325
Wait! Wait!

209
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:32,944
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

210
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:38,583
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

211
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,818
However,

212
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,619
once you have your retribution,

213
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,956
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

214
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,492
Curses come home to roost.

215
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:52,361
When you die, your soul will go to Hell.

216
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,667
What are these guys?!

217
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,361
What?

218
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:08,241
You've become a mom!

219
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:30,668
P-Pinky...

220
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,573
Wh-Why?!

221
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,176
I told you, didn't I?!
That I'd kill this dog!

222
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,278
Pinky! Pinky!

223
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,580
Hurry up and make breakfast!

224
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,315
-I'm hungry!
-Ow, that hurts!

225
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:46,651
-Please stop! Please stop!
-You better not be thinking
of starving me to death

226
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:50,348
and stealing my fortune!

227
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,626
Why?

228
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,961
Why did it end up this way?!

229
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,690
That day, I just...

230
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,102
I thought a change of scenery
would be good for once

231
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:07,505
and I took a different path
for our walk! That was all!

232
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:10,742
Yukky! Pinky!

233
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,972
Yukky!

234
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:16,980
Wait!

235
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:23,354
Yukky! Pinky!

236
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,423
Ow! Owowowowow!

237
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:27,392
Let go, you! Let go! It hurts!

238
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:29,994
Yukky! Yukky!

239
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,563
Are these your dogs?!

240
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,431
Not only did they make
a mess of my garden,

241
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,700
but they even bit my leg!

242
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,868
Unforgivable!

243
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,837
I'm going to hold you
responsible for this!

244
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:43,808
You said dogs that have
bitten people are put down,

245
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,344
so I did everything you told me to,

246
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:50,615
but before I knew it, Yukky and Pinky
were being treated like hostages!

247
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,550
When I asked my teacher,
he said it wasn't true!

248
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,786
They do get put down sometimes!

249
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,688
Like dogs that have become sick!

250
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:00,358
If this was how it was going to be,
I should've talked to my mom first!

251
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,193
Mom says she hates dogs, too,

252
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,328
but if I'd talked to her,
she probably would've helped...

253
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:04,862
I won't let you talk to anyone!

254
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:05,396
What?!

255
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:10,001
If you do that, these guys
will be dying one by one next!

256
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,298
What?!

257
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:16,708
You hear me?! Do you understand?!

258
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,510
You know, you say that,

259
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,678
but it's all that thing.

260
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,480
So it's all that thing!

261
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,881
He's got an axe, after all.

262
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:25,550
No, no, he ain't got one.

263
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,643
Why didn't I do it then?

264
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:33,152
If I had, Pinky would be...

265
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,661
We're not doing that!

266
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:37,762
Oh, well.

267
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:40,331
"Shibata Town"

268
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:44,802
Here! A change of clothes!

269
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,870
Oh, thanks.

270
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,006
Hajime, you stink!

271
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:50,541
You haven't had a bath in days, have you?!

272
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,677
What? D-Do I smell that bad?

273
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:57,415
Well, I couldn't let that
girl out of my sight, so...

274
00:17:57,415 --> 00:18:00,612
But considering how she looked,
maybe we're out of the woods.

275
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,589
-Did she come?
-What?

276
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,614
Hell Girl.

277
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,060
No.

278
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,830
Is what Hell Girl's doing bad?

279
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,866
Any action that results
in the taking of a life

280
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:18,002
is unforgivable, no matter
what reasons there might be.

281
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:21,272
But there are people in this world
who do even worse things

282
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:24,208
and think nothing of it, right?

283
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,044
That's true, but...

284
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:29,347
Who's going to punish
those people for us?

285
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,683
That's a different story.

286
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,651
Is it really?

287
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,982
Tsugumi.

288
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,225
"Simono"

289
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,593
Who is it?

290
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:45,196
Oh, I'm from the police box
in front of the station.

291
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,297
Police?!

292
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:48,433
I knew it! You saw it that time,
didn't you?!

293
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,234
What?! What are you talking about?!

294
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,769
I don't know anything about this!

295
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,404
I'll kill them!

296
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:54,539
Don't!

297
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,540
I'll kill them!

298
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,874
Don't!

299
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,243
-Kamikawa! Hey, Kamikawa!
-Hey, what's happening?! Open up!

300
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:00,712
What's going on?!

301
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:02,880
We heard one of my students
screaming inside!

302
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,938
This way!

303
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,555
Requesting backup!

304
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:12,614
The location is Shibata Town, 8-cho...

305
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,628
I have to hurry, or those puppies will...

306
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:19,289
Who are you people?!

307
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,935
You guys are after my fortune, too,
aren't you?!

308
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:26,137
-What?!
-Like hell I'm letting you have it!

309
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:30,475
That woman killed my dogs,
Yukky and Pinky!

310
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,744
I won't let anyone have it!

311
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:34,912
Stop this! You are hindering an officer!

312
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,147
Let go!

313
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,382
Like hell I'll hand it over!

314
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:38,983
Not even to my own child!

315
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,143
Hey!

316
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,985
Damn it! Let go! Let me go!

317
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,139
It seems she believed that the girl
had seen her child's skeleton.

318
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,340
That was why...

319
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,311
She didn't want to hand over her fortune,
even to her own child, huh?

320
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,677
What a terrible story.

321
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:17,017
That's a doll you got
from Hell Girl, right?

322
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,560
It's not something you need anymore.

323
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,027
Right?

324
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,131
What about them?!

325
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,361
What? Them?

326
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,504
Nooo!

327
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:35,606
They'd just been born!

328
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:38,943
I hadn't even given them names yet!

329
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:41,712
If only I'd sent her to Hell sooner!

330
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:42,180
-I could've done it at any time!
-Stop!

331
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,347
-I could've done it at any time!
-Stop!

332
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,713
Don't do it!

333
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:57,055
Your grievance has been heard.

334
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,936
I finally got my hands on that
fortune by killing my parents.

335
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:07,972
Like hell I'm going to
share it with some kid!

336
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:09,640
That's why you killed them?

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,075
That's right!

338
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:15,313
I'll kill any bastard that
gets in my way! Even dogs!

339
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,815
You might be an
experienced killer, but...

340
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:21,342
-I bet this is your
first time being killed.
-What?

341
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,295
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

342
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:34,131
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

343
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:37,032
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

344
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:41,138
Care to give death a try?

345
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:41,604
"Hell"

346
00:21:54,218 --> 00:21:56,721
I don't have time to be going to Hell!

347
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,624
If I don't get back in a hurry,
my fortune will be...

348
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:03,895
Do you have any idea how you look now?

349
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:05,487
Wh-What do you mean?!

350
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:07,589
Huh?

351
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:16,231
-Nooo!
-I consign this grievance to Hell...

352
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,493
If only I'd untied the thread earlier,

353
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,995
Pinky wouldn't have had to die, either!

354
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:41,362
And the puppies wouldn't
