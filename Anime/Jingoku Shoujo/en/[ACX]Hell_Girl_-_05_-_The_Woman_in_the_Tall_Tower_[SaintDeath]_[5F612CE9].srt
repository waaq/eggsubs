1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,895
It is said that life's
encounters are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,633
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,171
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,907
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:29,085
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,257
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,629
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,901
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:52,676
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:55,378
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,114
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:05,355
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,991
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:15,966
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,768
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:26,610
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,279
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:37,387
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,056
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:48,293
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,648
"Please, help me."

24
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,826
That one again, eh?

25
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,596
Day in and day out. Talk about persistent.

26
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,827
But you decided not to
take that request, right?

27
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:37,247
Are we being ignored again today?

28
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,482
I swear...

29
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,416
J-Just a little longer...

30
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:44,788
That's enough for today.

31
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:45,588
What?

32
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:48,091
Oh, hello? It's me!

33
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:52,084
I'm starving! How about
we go grab a bite to eat?

34
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:57,834
Yeah, I'm at the office right now. See you!

35
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:01,604
Man, if only I could make
the acquaintance of Hell Girl,

36
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:05,375
this company could easily double in size.

37
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,004
Oh, but if that happened,
I guess you'd be out of a job.

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,915
I'll see you bright and early tomorrow.

39
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:15,485
What? I have final exams tomorrow.

40
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,287
There's a board meeting.

41
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:21,849
Misato, who do you think you even
owe the fact that you're in school?

42
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,404
"Dead Line Incorporated
Dead Line Incorporated Reception
Dead Line Incorporated
Asano Planning, Inc."

43
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,587
Good night.

44
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,521
Good night, I'll be going now.

45
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,729
"Fujimi Housing"

46
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:20,116
"The Woman in the Tall Tower"

47
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,150
"Dead Line Incorporated"

48
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,820
"Dead Line Incorporated"
Yes, the online shop Dead Line

49
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,353
Yes, the online shop Dead Line

50
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:27,123
is a company our president,
Riho Kaifu, started

51
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:29,751
with a couple friends
when she was a student.

52
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:35,198
Ms. Riho is the only one
left of the original founders,

53
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:39,802
but with her rich knowledge of
computers and business acumen,

54
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:44,073
she's grown the company
to this size in just 4 years!

55
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,409
She must be an incredible woman.

56
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,512
All the employees look up to her.

57
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:52,982
Can you believe it?! In just 4 years!

58
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:55,384
Hey! When you put it like that,

59
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,354
you make it sound as if I used
some unscrupulous methods.

60
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:01,991
I'm sorry. That was hardly what I meant.

61
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,860
Is this our new part-timer?

62
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,494
What?

63
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:07,964
I'm Onda. Nice to meet you.

64
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,299
I'm the president, Riho Kaifu.

65
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,868
I look forward to working
with you, Ms. Onda.

66
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,165
Likewise!

67
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:19,442
Yes, so regarding the
M&A of Midori Communications...

68
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:23,646
Mr. Midorikawa, the largest shareholder,
is vehemently against it

69
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,482
and that puts us in a
rather tough situation.

70
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:29,252
Please be persistent and
continue to negotiate with him.

71
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:32,221
But it seems incredibly unlikely
that he will change his mind...

72
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:36,526
If we do not give up,
a providential wind might blow our way.

73
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:39,362
After all, that has been true in the past.

74
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,163
I understand.

75
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:45,601
Next, on the matter of increasing
the number of host computers...

76
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,803
Please take a look at the data before you.

77
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,339
-Along with the expansion
of the fiber optics network,
-Oh, Ms. Riho...

78
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,308
-each home...
-Oh, Ms. Riho...

79
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:56,112
With regards to that,
you are a pro among pros.

80
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,444
We will leave it entirely in your hands.

81
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,386
I'm honored.

82
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:06,355
Those directors are all idiots.

83
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,949
I didn't need you to come in.

84
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,697
A girl that looks like
she's in high school?

85
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:18,501
Yes. I saw her earlier
in front of the bathroom.

86
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,337
Oh, that's probably Misato.

87
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:25,841
Misato Urano. She's supposed to be
a distant relative of Ms. Riho's.

88
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,977
You'll see her around the office
from time to time.

89
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:30,413
Misato Urano, huh?

90
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:34,050
I think she's in her first
or second year in high school.

91
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,021
Her parents have passed away,
so Ms. Riho's looking after her.

92
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:44,193
She's treated like a part-timer here.
Sort of a real world education.

93
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:46,162
I had no idea.

94
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:49,031
But for all that she's
related to our president,

95
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,434
she's absolutely no good with computers.

96
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:54,503
So, she's a part-timer, but about
all she does is clean, make tea,

97
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:58,574
and act as a kind of companion
when the president is working late alone.

98
00:06:58,574 --> 00:06:59,742
I see.

99
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:03,946
And then there's
Ms. Riho's old boyfriend...

100
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,349
Hey! You're talking too much!

101
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:10,453
Next up is news of a death.

102
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:14,624
The former president of
Midori Communications, Raizo Midorikawa,

103
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:17,024
still the largest shareholder, has died...

104
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:23,366
Of the Midori Communications shares
that I, Raizo Midorikawa, own,

105
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:28,497
I grant 75% of those shares to
President Riho Kaifu of Dead Line.

106
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:32,408
Maybe "grant" is going too far...

107
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,176
Oh, well.

108
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:37,847
Okay, pop that on to
that old geezer's PC for me.

109
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,716
Make it so it was written
maybe 10 days ago.

110
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:44,553
I'll alter the file's
property and registry.

111
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:46,789
So, which directory should I put it in?

112
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,091
I'll leave that stuff up to you.

113
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:54,363
Properties this, servers that.
It's all gibberish to me.

114
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,332
I can't understand how people
even manage to work with PCs!

115
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,670
Oh, it's time.

116
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,175
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

117
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,411
Make it more extreme today.

118
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:12,279
Something they'll believe
we'd want revenge for.

119
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,958
So it was uploaded by someone else...

120
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,262
It's just like the Miss suspected.

121
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,364
Ignoring us again?!

122
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:31,267
Maybe Hell Girl doesn't
really exist, after all!

123
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,438
Misato, go through that homepage
and find out who's behind it!

124
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:37,606
Should be a piece of cake for you.

125
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,575
Especially compared to
stealing data on new products

126
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,678
or messing with account balances.

127
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:43,612
But...

128
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:46,916
Do you want to go back to
being the shoplifting girl?

129
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,284
That's not it.

130
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:50,853
I tried that the other day at your request,

131
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:55,458
but instead, they came through
our firewall and almost got in.

132
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,094
That's not my problem!

133
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,262
Shoplifting girl, huh?

134
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,059
Troubling.

135
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,960
Yeah.

136
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:15,933
"Loop"

137
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,183
Wow! This shop is a
subsidiary of Dead Line?!

138
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,986
Huh? You know about our parent company?

139
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:27,289
My ex-girlfriend shopped with them a lot.

140
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:31,660
But I heard that company
only employs women.

141
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,963
That even their part-timers
are all women...

142
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,297
Now, they do.

143
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:38,334
There was a time when
they had men like me, too.

144
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:42,171
But the focus of the company
shifted towards women,

145
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:46,575
so the men wound up
reassigned to outside subsidiaries.

146
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:48,377
When you get down to it,
we were demoted, really.

147
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:51,614
There's no chance we'll be
reinstated at the main office.

148
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:56,519
Oh, that's right! I can never
go back to the main office!

149
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,089
Yeah, that's what being demoted means!

150
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,258
-I-I can never go back!
-S-Sir, get a hold of yourself!

153

155
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:20,075
Shoplifting?

156
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,771
It happens, right? Even in your store?

157
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,547
Sure, every once in a while.

158
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,720
That reminds me, I got an
odd memo about a year ago.

159
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,855
Memo?

160
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,424
Yeah, it said that if
we caught a shoplifter,

161
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,961
we were to contact the president
before reporting it to the police.

162
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:39,929
Huh.

163
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,064
And then it turned out
a girl I caught in my store

164
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,866
was related to the president.

165
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,534
Related to the president?!

166
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:48,938
Oh, no, no. Forget what I said.
Never mind all that.

167
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:52,007
What?! After you told me all that?!

168
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,703
Ms. Riho's told us not to talk about it.

169
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:57,746
But...

170
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:00,482
Maybe I will tell you.

171
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,416
-What?!
-About all sorts of things!

172
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:16,198
At the office, this girl is thought
to be useless with a computer, but...

173
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:21,003
Nope. According to the shop owner,
she's quite the computer geek.

174
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,738
She builds her own machines

175
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:25,074
and is supposedly capable
of hacker-type work, too.

176
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,308
Conversely...

177
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:29,411
The president is no good with computers.

178
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,513
Oh, you knew.

179
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:34,717
Watching their dealings in her office,
it was easy to figure out.

180
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:40,356
Furthermore, that girl
and Ms. Riho are not related.

181
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,157
Oh, they're not?

182
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,193
I checked into it during the day.

183
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:47,763
Incidentally, the ex-boyfriend
she started the company with

184
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:50,900
was apparently very
knowledgeable about computers.

185
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,037
Though, they seem to have
broken up before the company got big.

186
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,338
I get it now.

187
00:11:56,338 --> 00:12:00,609
That's when she suddenly needed
someone good with computers.

188
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:04,179
And she thought of how she could
use a shoplifter to her advantage!

189
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,616
Make them help her in exchange for
not handing them over to the police.

190
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:10,853
And she's the one that fell into that trap.

191
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:15,916
Well, that's the sort of illegal methods
she's used to grow her company.

192
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:18,960
Really?

193
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:39,548
Hello?

194
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:43,986
Hey, Misato, I just got a call
from some weird man.

195
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,822
He's demanding I pay 100 million

196
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:48,791
if I don't want the company secrets leaked.

197
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,059
Is it a hacker?

198
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:53,462
Finding that out is your job!

199
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,530
You listen to me.

200
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,092
Make sure you find out who he is
before I get to the office tomorrow!

201
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:13,941
Getting in to work at this hour, eh?

202
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:23,058
Oh, my head hurts. Must be a hang over.

203
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:26,462
This is the issue you asked me
to handle yesterday.

204
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:29,365
Why don't you go to school for once?

205
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,500
Okay.

206
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,469
Also...

207
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:37,206
Let's take a break from
the Hell Girl thing for a while.

208
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:40,809
Staying up late night after night
like this isn't good for my skin.

209
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:41,867
Okay.

210
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:52,143
Hello? It's me!

211
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,226
"Metropolitan Police Department"

212
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:07,503
The man whose body was found
was Toru Kobayashi, age 33.

213
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:08,731
He was in the Metropolitan area...

214
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,743
The target is Toru Kobayashi, age 33.

215
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:16,578
I'll leave the method up to you.

216
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,614
Just take care of it quickly.

217
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,549
At last, with this...

218
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,210
At last, what?

219
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,724
At last, with this, you can
get the police to arrest me?

220
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,292
If I'm questioned about further crimes,

221
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:33,853
you think they might turn up evidence
that I murdered your father, too?

222
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,401
Like father, like daughter, I guess.

223
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:41,770
The way you're both good with computers

224
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,829
and the ultimate fate you'll both share!

225
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:47,476
Your father was the same.

226
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,511
In exchange for not pursuing
sexual assault charges,

227
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,911
he ended up helping me.

228
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,915
Not that he was guilty of those charges.

229
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,410
"Copying
Remaining Time 10 Sec
Cancel"

230
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:01,457
But his guilty conscience
got to be too much for him

231
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:04,255
and when he tried to
report me to the police...

232
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,689
...he disappeared from this world.

233
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,971
It must have been tough
for you to find my company.

234
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:20,809
After all, the fact he worked here
was strictly confidential.

235
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,144
Urano...

236
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,203
No, Misato Tamura!

237
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:26,982
How...

238
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,118
I can't use computers,

239
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:34,156
but there's a handy profession
called "investigator".

240
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,525
When I was having trouble
after I'd gotten rid of Tamura,

241
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:39,328
you showed up at the perfect time.

242
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,330
It got me a little suspicious.

243
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,997
So I hired an investigator
and had him look into it.

244
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:44,500
"-Cade PC Pavilion"
So I hired an investigator
and had him look into it.

245
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,230
"-Cade PC Pavilion"

246
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:51,273
You got caught shoplifting
on purpose, right?

247
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:53,976
So you could infiltrate this company.

248
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:57,810
You also allowed that hacker to get in,
so you could get dirt on me.

249
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:02,251
But too bad! I've turned
the tables on you!

250
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:05,287
Your actions haven't been secret at all!

251
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,889
S-Someone!

252
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,894
It's no use. This guy took care
of the security guard just earlier.

253
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,596
Don't you think anything of human life?!

254
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:18,834
Come on, after you kill one person,
it doesn't matter how many you kill.

255
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,803
That's how I've grown this company.

256
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:24,473
You're definitely going to Hell!

257
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,875
We're talking decades until that happens.

258
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,178
Life is ultimately just a game.

259
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:32,147
Whoever enjoys herself the most
before the game's over wins.

260
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,692
Don't let her get away!

261
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,793
Darn it!

262
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:48,230
It's because of contingencies like this
that I wanted to use Hell Girl!

263
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,131
Men are so useless
when you need them most!

264
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,248
Midnight!

265
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,580
That's right! Hell Link!

266
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:12,653
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

267
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,623
Please, kill Riho Kaifu for me!

268
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:15,612
"Kaifu
Send"
Please, kill Riho Kaifu for me!

269
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:18,126
Please!

270
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:18,493
"Send"
Please!

271
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:18,959
"Send"

272
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,406
You summoned me, remember?

273
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,675
Wh-Who are you?!

274
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:36,078
I am Ai Enma.

275
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,847
Hell Girl?!

276
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,350
Take it.

277
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,187
If you really want retribution,

278
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,756
untie this red thread.

279
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:53,161
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

280
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:57,427
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

281
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:00,636
Right away?!

282
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,738
Not decades from now?!

283
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,006
Yes.

284
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,307
However,

285
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,842
once you have your retribution,

286
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:10,078
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

287
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:12,981
Curses come home to roost.

288
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:16,551
After you die, your soul will go to Hell.

289
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,520
This world is Hell!

290
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,317
As long as that woman is alive!

291
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:25,249
Your grievance has been heard.

292
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,530
Did you take care of her?!

293
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:37,895
At least answer me!

294
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:47,449
This is!

295
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:47,916
"Dead Line Incorporated"
This is!

296
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,406
"Dead Line Incorporated"

297
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:54,546
Oh, right. I...

298
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,159
Kenji, are these the hard disks...

299
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:08,395
I-It's not what you think, Riho!
I can explain!

300
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,113
H-He's dead!

301
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,308
Riho, what have you done?!

302
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,316
Like hell...I'm going to...
let you people...mess up my life!

303
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,536
I've found my resolve, thanks to you!

304
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:43,505
No matter what methods I have to use,

305
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,841
I'll win the game of life!

306
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,877
Even if I have to sacrifice
every person out there!

307
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,480
You'll be the first.

308
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,142
You'll be the first to be sacrificed.

309
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,383
You're next.

310
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:07,028
What are you doing in a place
like this, Ms. Riho?

311
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:07,295
"Dead Line Incorporated"

312
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,698
"Dead Line Incorporated"
I-In a place like this?

313
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:11,600
"Dead Line Incorporated"
The gateway to Hell.

314
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,033
"Dead Line Incorporated"
What?!

315
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,034
What?!

316
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,400
I told you it's your turn, didn't I?

317
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:28,250
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

318
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,752
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

319
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:33,482
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

320
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,581
Care to give death a try?

321
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,440
Why?!

322
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,444
Why do I have to be killed
over and over again?!

323
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:57,078
Not over and over.

324
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:57,976
What?

325
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,814
For eternity.

326
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:09,019
I consign this grievance to Hell...

327
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,768
Hey, did you hear?

328
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:24,172
The thief they caught last night is
saying he killed the security guard!

329
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,409
But the security guard guy
is alive and well.

330
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,413
That's just it! Maybe he
was dreaming or something.

331
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:33,114
But talk about disappointing!

332
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:36,418
To think Ms. Riho was absolutely
no good with computers!

333
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:40,422
It was apparently Misato that was
doing all the president's work.

334
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:41,556
And I hear,

335
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:45,660
starting today, she's going to be
living in Ms. Riho's condo, but...

336
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,262
Who are you talking to?

337
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:48,663
Huh?

338
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:50,932
Uh, who was I talking to?

339
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:54,069
That's what I want to know!

340
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,437
Good work.

341
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,739
How did you like the
life of an "office lady"?

342
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:02,005
Sitting in front of a desk
all day just isn't my thing.

343
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:07,338
Lost in the darkness...

344
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,986
Wow!

345
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:32,007
When I die, I'm going
to Hell without fail.

346
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,709
We're talking decades until that happens.

347
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,012
Life is ultimately just a game.

348
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:41,216
Whoever enjoys herself the most
before the game's over wins.

349
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:44,653
Yeah, that's true.

350
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:48,453
I'm going to enjoy this game
to my heart's content.

351
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:54,396
"Misato Tamura"

352
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:58,400
"Misato Tamura"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

353
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,163
"Misato Tamura"

354
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:19,983
Always a dead end

355
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:26,656
There is no escape

356
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:34,764
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

357
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:39,030
And I'll let it fly

358
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,443
This place is ephemeral

359
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:58,421
An eternity that binds me

360
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:05,428
Coming or going

361
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:16,999
All that passes by are dreams

362
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:30,152
This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental.

363
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,122
Your name?

364
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,124
Haruka Yasuda.

365
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,826
You hate her?

366
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:41,898
Just because of what she saw that day
through the window, Mother is...

367
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:42,999
I feel so sorry for her.

368
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,634
I can't stand to see her like this!

369
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,436
Your wish?

370
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:50,340
Banish her to Hell for me!

371
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,611
Your grievance has been heard.

372
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:55,511
Next time, "Early Afternoon Window".

373
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,014
"Hell Girl
Early Afternoon Window"
Next time, "Early Afternoon Window".

374
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,073
"Hell Girl
Early Afternoon Window"
