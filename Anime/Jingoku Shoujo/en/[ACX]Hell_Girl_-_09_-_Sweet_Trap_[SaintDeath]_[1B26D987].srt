1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:05,195
It is said that life's
encounters are governed by fate.

2
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:07,330
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,933
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:14,471
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:17,207
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:28,919
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,090
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,462
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:44,734
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:52,509
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,212
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:57,948
Rain again today

14
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:05,188
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,824
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:15,799
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,602
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:26,443
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:29,112
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:37,220
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,889
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:48,126
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:19,184
Did he really disappear?

24
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,966
Please, I just want to talk to her.

25
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:23,466
"Tanuma"
Please, I just want to talk to her.

26
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:26,703
"Tanuma"
As I told you, my daughter
says she does not want to see you!

27
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:26,903
As I told you, my daughter
says she does not want to see you!

28
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:28,571
If you would just convince her to see me...

29
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,597
If you don't stop this already,
I am calling the police!

30
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,887
Yes? Shibata here.

31
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:46,022
Just how long are you
going to make me wait?!

32
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:46,523
What?

33
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:49,225
The photos! What happened to the photos?!

34
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,093
Photos?

35
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,928
Shibata, you!

36
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,954
Ah, right, I'll definitely
get it to you within the week.

37
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,365
Crap, I'd totally forgotten about it.

38
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,854
Hiromi made these?

39
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:18,688
Yes!

40
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:21,458
And this is our shop's main offering.

41
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,060
Sis is very confident about this creation.

42
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,755
Please give it a try.

43
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,007
What do you think?

44
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,635
This texture is... soybean milk skin...

45
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,679
It's delicious.

46
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,014
Really?!

47
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:50,487
That's Hiromi for you. This flavor
would be difficult to create.

48
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,856
Her talent will be missed.

49
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:56,493
In all honesty, I wish she would've
kept up her great work here instead.

50
00:03:56,493 --> 00:04:00,230
Wow! Thank you very much!

51
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,467
But it's been my dream and hers
to open up our own shop, so...

52
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:07,036
As well as your father's.

53
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,838
Yes.

54
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,542
Oh, if you'd like,
please give this one a try, too.

55
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:18,581
Oh, but I think the cheese
and tofu one here is also quite good.

56
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:23,541
"Sweet Trap"

57
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,846
"Jul. 2 (Sat)
We will await your visit
with a collection of original creations."

58
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,366
It's all ready, I see!

59
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,901
Welcome back.

60
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:48,440
Wow! So this is the kind of kitchen
that Father had envisioned.

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,808
Thank you, Yuka.

62
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,009
What?

63
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,078
We were able to open
our own shop this quickly

64
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:56,047
thanks to you working
part-time jobs every day

65
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,382
and saving up for this with me.

66
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,918
Come on, it was a given that I did that.

67
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,020
After all, we decided this together.

68
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,885
I know, but...

69
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:11,152
I wish Father could've
made his cakes here, too.

70
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:36,221
Father...

71
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:39,023
But the crucial part is still ahead of us!

72
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:43,395
We have to rake it in and pay back
all the debt we've still got left!

73
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:44,596
Right.

74
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,866
And this is where I've got
great news to tell you!

75
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,493
Great news?

76
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,974
What? You went to Mr. Morisaki's place?

77
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:56,708
Yup!

78
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,810
When I took your cakes over,

79
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,414
he said he'd get this shop
on "The Corner Patisserie"!

80
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:03,281
What?!

81
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:07,115
That show is popular,
so it'll be good advertisement!

82
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,824
So, the shoot will be
next week on Saturday.

83
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,894
H-Hold on, Yuka, that's the day...

84
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,830
He suggested that we take
this chance to do it on opening day.

85
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,357
Mr. Morisaki is such a really nice person!

86
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:28,706
Oh, and he suggested we should
present the "Heritage" on that day.

87
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:31,641
He was full of praise for you, Sis!

88
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:37,507
"Amano"

89
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,286
The people in the neighborhood are
also extremely inconvenienced by it.

90
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:45,089
The Ward Office realizes
something must be done about it,

91
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,460
but the fact is, no good resolution
has presented itself at this point.

92
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,830
-These aren't very good photos...
-This was the Raging Bomber,
Kimi, reporting.

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,064
-Man, I'm gonna get chewed out
by the chief editor again.
-Next up is

94
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,055
-Man, I'm gonna get chewed out
by the chief editor again.
-"The Corner Patisserie" segment.

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,339
Wow!

96
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,209
They look delicious!

97
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,144
Today, we're starting with Mr. Morisaki.

98
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:10,348
We'll have him introduce
the new creation at Chez Morisaki.

99
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,683
This is it.

100
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,918
What is this cake called?

101
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,116
Its name is "Ivresse" and it
contains a secret ingredient...
("lvresse" = "intoxication" in French)

102
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,429
D-Do you think we'll do okay?

103
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:27,332
It'll be fine! Just leave it to me!

104
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,835
Okay, we have one minute until we go live.

105
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:34,339
And now, let's call in Ms. Itou as usual.

106
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,707
Ms. Itou!

107
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:39,944
Here I am! I'm Itou,
the reporter with a sweet tooth.

108
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:44,582
We are here with a patisserie
called Le reve, which is opening today.

109
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:47,151
This is the owner and patissier,
Miss Hiromi Kasuga.

110
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:50,121
And her younger sister, Miss Yuka.

111
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,491
Now, let's get right to
introducing your cakes.

112
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:58,394
Right. This is our house specialty,
the "Heritage".

113
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,738
Th-This cake is something Sis...

114
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:11,910
I mean, o-our patissier had
been thinking of for a long time.

115
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,712
-This cake is the same as
the one they just showed.
-Soybean milk skin

116
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:17,115
-Ouch, this is harsh.
-Has been finely mixed
into the dough and...

117
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:20,018
That's the same as Mr. Morisaki's creation.

118
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:22,787
What's going on?! Get me
the people on location!

119
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:24,355
It looks like a Western-style cake,

120
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,423
but when you taste it,

121
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:28,221
-it'll have a really nostalgic flavor...
-We're cutting to commercial!

122
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,930
They cut to commercial.

123
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,532
That's gotta suck.

124
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:37,524
Oh! My deadline, my deadline.

125
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:41,839
It's the same as Mr. Morisaki's cake?!

126
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,842
Just what does that mean?!

127
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:48,980
So, like I said, it's partly our fault
for not doing our research,

128
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,917
but I never expected for two
of the same thing to show up!

129
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,386
I don't really care if you guys
copy him, but of all things...

130
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,788
We did not copy him!

131
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:57,722
Yuka!

132
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:00,258
But Sis...

133
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:04,429
This is messed up!
We're the ones who really...

134
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:05,697
I am sorry about this.

135
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,221
Sis?!

136
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,961
Sis!

137
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,712
Excuse me?

138
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:23,114
Please forgive me.

139
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:26,684
Um, out of 2000 yen?

140
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:29,020
-Please wait a moment.
-Hey, hey, have you heard of Hell Link?

141
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,357
Oh, yeah, if you access
the site at midnight,

142
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:35,026
it's supposed to avenge
your grievance, right?

143
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:36,653
Yeah, that's the one!

144
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,233
I stayed at my job too long.

145
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,836
I have to get back fast to help out!

146
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:45,894
Oh...

147
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,407
This is the shop, right?

148
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,343
The one that stole one of
Chez Morisaki's cake ideas?

149
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,879
I hear she used to be
one of his apprentices.

150
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,814
It'll probably go
out of business soon enough.

151
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:59,180
Well, I suppose so.

152
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:04,889
I'm back.

153
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,391
Welcome back.

154
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,659
Is something the matter?

155
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,028
Not really.

156
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,295
Any customers?

157
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,559
Just two so far today.

158
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:20,805
Sis, I still think I should go see him.

159
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,573
This is just too terrible!

160
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,875
You can't do that.

161
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,677
Sis!

162
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:27,912
It's no use going now.

163
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:28,980
So don't go.

164
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,709
But at this rate!

165

00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,413
I'm coming.

177
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:02,733
"Your message was received.
Hell Girl"

178
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:07,678
Hell... Girl?

179
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,009
Who's there?!

180
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,551
You summoned me, remember?

181
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,486
I am Ai Enma.

182
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,081
Then, you're Hell Girl?

183
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:22,850
Wait!

184
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:36,396
She's here.

185
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:40,236
So you were deceived.

186
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:47,451
My late father, my sis,
and I dreamed of having our own shop.

187
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,453
It was our family dream!

188
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,123
And that dream was shattered.

189
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:55,326
Please, avenge us.

190
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,495
Do you hate that man?

191
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,230
Enough to want to kill him?

192
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,866
W-Well...

193
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,501
Wanyuudou.

194
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,662
Yes, Miss.

195
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:14,445
Take it.

196
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,947
What is that?

197
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:20,952
If you really want retribution,

198
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,754
untie this red thread.

199
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:29,560
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

200
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,997
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

201
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,634
However...

202
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,236
What?

203
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,904
...once you have your retribution,

204
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:43,207
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

205
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:45,376
Price?

206
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,679
Curses come home to roost.

207
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,582
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

208
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,822
You will never see Heaven,

209
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:03,261
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

210
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,663
Though, that's only after you die.

211
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,062
What?

212
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,567
N-No!

213
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,905
All that remains is for you to decide.

214
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:28,916
H-Huh?

215
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:43,034
The loan is being terminated?!

216
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,470
I tried to negotiate
with the higher ups, but...

217
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,141
If you had at least been
paying off the interest...

218
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,944
I promise I will pay back
the amount that I am late by!

219
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:56,480
So is there any way you
could wait a little longer?

220
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,050
Unfortunately, that's not
really within my power.

221
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,618
If you could just talk to them somehow...

222
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,950
"JGS Bank"

223
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,522
Yeah.

224
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,854
Okay, I understand. Good work.

225
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,861
Was that satisfactory,

226
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:13,230
Mr. Morisaki?

227
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,333
More than enough.

228
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,961
I appreciate you taking the
trouble to do this, Branch Manager.

229
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,816
"Space For Rent
Midoriyama Corporation, Inc."

230
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:43,194
Yuka, let's get going.

231
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,596
Yuka...

232
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,365
I'm sorry, Sis!

233
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:52,503
If I hadn't gone to that guy,
this wouldn't have happened!

234
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,338
It's not your fault, Yuka.

235
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:57,008
Why do we have to be put through all this?!

236
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:00,411
We haven't done anything wrong!

237
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,345
Sis!

238
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:04,949
I need to tell you something.

239
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:06,684
What?

240
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,174
Sis?

241
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:19,858
"A Patisserie Evening
Guest Shinya Morisaki
Sponsor Medaka TV, Inc."

242
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:30,541
I heard about your shop.
You have my condolences.

243
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,543
You put us out of business!

244
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:36,414
And you did that just
because Sis rejected you!

245
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,649
You kept pursuing her even though
you knew she wasn't interested,

246
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,019
and you did that just
because she turned you down?!

247
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,856
You're despicable!
No wonder she rejected you!

248
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:49,660
Say what you will. You're not
getting your shop back now.

249
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,996
Besides, I'm grateful to you.

250
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,264
What?

251
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:57,968
After all, you gave me the perfect
opportunity to exact my revenge.

252
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:01,305
But I never expected
things would go so well.

253
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:04,275
I haven't been in such
a good mood in ages.

254
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:08,302
You'll just have to work hard
to pay off your debts.

255
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:12,683
If you want, I could introduce
you to a nice establishment.

256
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:16,813
After all, you two are
both quite the beauties.

257
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:20,187
Well, good luck.

258
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,399
Unforgivable...

259
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,333
You are not getting away with this!

260
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:46,775
Your grievance has been heard.

261
00:17:56,093 --> 00:18:00,131
Ai, I'll leave your under-kimono here.

262
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,962
Thank you, Grandma.

263
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,034
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

264
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,638
please enjoy Chez Morisaki's new cake!

265
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:41,839
It looks delicious!

266
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,171
Just what you'd expect
of Mr. Morisaki's work!

267
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,146
What's with this cake?!

268
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:51,482
This tastes so bad,
it's not even palatable!

269
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,950
Do you take us for fools?!

270
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,119
Trying to feed us this crap!

271
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,354
Wh-What are you doing?!

272
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,049
Stop! Stop this!

273
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:06,063
Shinya Morisaki?

274
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:09,066
Yeah, from the TV show
we saw the other day.

275
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,901
The girl was there, too.

276
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,631
What?! That girl with the same cake?!

277
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:16,939
Oh...

278
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,313
Wait! It's not me!

279
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:25,373
I'm not the one who made that cake!

280
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:31,422
Then it was true that you stole this cake?

281
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:33,791
And all to get back at a woman
who rejected you?

282
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,326
This is a real scoop.

283
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:37,658
So how about it, Mr. Morisaki?

284
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,561
He ran away!

285
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:46,764
Wh-What was that?!
What the hell is going on?!

286
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,941
Hiromi...

287
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:56,080
Mr. Morisaki, the truth is,
I cared for you as well.

288
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,616
H-Hiromi...

289
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,718
Please, eat me.

290
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:01,986
What?

291
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:05,149
Please, eat me!

292
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,196
I don't care where we go, just get going!

293
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:13,993
I understand.

294
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,570
What the hell is happening?
Am I dreaming or something?

295
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,773
Sir, you like sweet things, right?

296
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:23,899
What?

297
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,575
H-Help!

298
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,208
Has it gotten through to you a little?

299
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,157
Those two worked so hard
to set up their own shop.

300
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,759
What a horrible thing to do.

301
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,561
Repent for what you did.

302
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:48,499
Repent?! Why must I repent?!

303
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,200
I was serious!

304
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,369
I loved her!

305
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,405
That's why I gave her special attention!

306
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:58,208
She's the one who betrayed me!
I've done nothing wrong!

307
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,176
So he says, Miss.

308
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:06,116
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

309
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:08,485
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

310
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,147
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

311
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,693
Care to give death a try?

312
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,272
Wh-Where am I?! Where are we going?!

313
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,681
Answer me!

314
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:40,912
I'm never letting you have
one of my cakes again.

315
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:48,383
I consign this grievance to Hell...

316
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:06,877
Where's Mr. Morisaki?!

317
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,245
The thing is, he's nowhere to be found!

318
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,216
There's no way he's not around!
Hurry up and go find him!

319
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,706
Looks like I was too late.

320
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:21,091
Thank you very much!

321
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,395
I appreciate you coming.

322
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:27,131
I'm sorry for being late!

323
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,499
Here's your lunch.

324
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:29,733
Thank you.

325
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:32,269
Well, I have to go to work now.

326
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,370
Be careful.

327
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,735
I will!

328
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,430
Welcome!

329
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:43,881
Sis, I haven't given up yet.

330
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:47,373
We're going to open up
our own shop again, no matter what!

331
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:54,658

332
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:58,729

00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,196
"Yuka Kasuga"

334
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:19,946
Always a dead end

335
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:26,619
There is no escape

336
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:34,727
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

337
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:38,993
And I'll let it fly

338
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:47,407
This place is ephemeral

339
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:58,384
An eternity that binds me

340
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:05,391
Coming or going

341
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:16,962

Minami Shibuya.

345
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:39,092
Are you really sure?
She's your friend, isn't she?

346
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:40,894
She was my friend.

347
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:43,796
I thought she was my one
and only true friend,

348
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:46,366
but after what she did...

349
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:47,800
I can't forgive her.

350
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,869
Your wish?

351
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,372
Banish her to Hell for me!

352
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:55,808
