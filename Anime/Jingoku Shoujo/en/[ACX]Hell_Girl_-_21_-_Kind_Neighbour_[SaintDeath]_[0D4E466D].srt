1
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:03,192
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,861
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,996
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:09,599
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,137
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,873
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,081
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

9
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:34,253
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

10
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:39,625
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,897
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

12
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:52,671
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

13
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,374
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

14
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:58,110
Rain again today

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,351
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

16
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,987
In this craziness, uncertainty

17
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:15,961
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

18
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,764
In this craziness, you gave me life

19
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:26,605
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

20
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,274
In this craziness, uncertainty

21
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:37,383
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

22
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,052
In this craziness, you gave me life

23
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:48,289
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

24
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,691
Does it bother you that much?

25
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,837
Sure, it bothers me.

26
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:07,609
There's no guarantee that Hell
Girl will notify you each time...

27
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,712
...and I want to stop her,
no matter what.

28
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:14,315
Tsugumi thinks what
Hell Girl does is fine, though.

29
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:17,719
The people that get sent to
Hell are all bad people, anyway.

30
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,654
Tsugumi...

31
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:20,985
I'm done.

32
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,426
Hey, Tsugu-

33
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,688
Sheesh!

34
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:31,654
Tsugumi?!

35
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,180
Tsugumi!

36
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,916
Tsugumi!

37
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,383
Tsugumi!!

38
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,222
You okay, Tsugumi?

39
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,292
Yuko was with Hell Girl...

40
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,227
Yuko?

41
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:01,296
Mr. Murai's...

42
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,660
My senior's?!

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,662
"Kind Neighbor"

44
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,666
Come to think of it,

45
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,002
they didn't come by this year,
did they?

46
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,204
They came last year, remember?

47
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:17,604
"We Wish You the Best in this Hot Weather
...a tough time, but we are happy
to hear that you are all doing well."
They came last year, remember?

48
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,207
"We Wish You the Best in this Hot Weather
...a tough time, but we are happy
to hear that you are all doing well."
They brought vegetables that
they grew on their farm.

49
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:20,574
They brought vegetables that
they grew on their farm.

50
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:22,201
Oh...

51
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,318
Father!

52
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,321
Oh, you've been drinking
so much again!

53
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:35,989
I'm sorry that he always does this.

54
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,024
Nah, I don't really mind...

55
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm not gonna drink!

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,027
I won't drink anymore!

57
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:41,394
"Oden Shop"
I won't drink anymore!

58
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:44,030
"Oden Shop"
I understand,
so let's go home, Father.

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,520
"Oden Shop"

60
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:51,131
Hajime, what kind of flower is that?

61
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,512
Red spider lilies, aren't they?

62
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,207
Red spider lilies...

63
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:24,797
Let's hurry.

64
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:33,275
Damn guy showed up, as expected.

65
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,350
Mr. Murai!

66
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,753
Mr. Murai!

67
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,448
I wonder if they're not home.

68
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,457
Mr. Murai?

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,329
Yuko?

70
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,990
Is no one here?

71
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:57,859
Miss Yuko!

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,575
Tsugumi...

73
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,090
Mr. Murai...

74
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,334
Do you want some more?

75
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,536
No, thank you.

76
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,405
How are you doing?
Feeling a little better?

77
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,274
Yes...

78
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,276
What in the world happened?

79
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,767
I was totally under the impression
that the farm was going well.

80
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,518
Won't you tell us?

81
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:46,780
Yuko...

82
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,226
It was two years ago...

83
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:56,525
Right after we'd moved here.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,300
There we go...

85
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:10,777
Whoa!

86
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,642
That was close.

87
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,512
Father!

88
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,053
Working hard there, I see!

89
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,956
The man's name was Ryosuke Sekine.

90
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,759
He lived on the other
side of the farm.

91
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,061
I apologize for my earlier behavior.

92
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,130
Maybe it's because I used
to work for a publishing company,

93
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,899
but I have this habit of
being suspicious of strangers.

94
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:36,503
And it doesn't seem like
we're very welcome here, so...

95
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:37,697
Thank you for the food.

96
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:42,140
It's delicious!

97
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:46,413
Here you go.

98
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,347
Oh, no, not me.

99
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:53,019
I've had a lot of bad experiences,
so I don't drink anymore.

100
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,182
Is that right? That's too bad.

101
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:03,730
But quitting a company job!
That's quite a daring move.

102
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,867
I inherited this vast place
from my uncle, after all.

103
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,770
It would be a shame
to just let it sit here.

104
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,872
And ever since I lost my wife,

105
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:15,642
I've had to leave my little girl
here alone so much.

106
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:19,746
I thought I could be around
for her a little more out here.

107
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,714
We're going to grow vegetables.

108
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:26,219
We're complete amateurs,
so I'm sure it won't be easy,

109
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,122
but we decided we'd work
hard at it together. Right?

110
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:31,291
Yup.

111
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,793
In that case, I might be able
to offer you some advice.

112
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,396
Since I used to do it long ago, too.

113
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,897
Really?!

114
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:39,666
I don't know how much
help I'll be...

115
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,169
Isn't that great, Yuko?
He says he'll lend us a hand.

116
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,637
Yeah!

117
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:49,509
After that, he began to
come to our place every day.

118
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,346
How to work the field.
How to pick seeds.

119
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,249
Even how to water
and fertilize the plants.

120
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,581
He was very generous
in teaching us.

121
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,426
In town, we'd be treated
as outsiders.

122
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:10,419
For Father, that man was the
only person he had to talk to.

123
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:12,899
Thanks to that man,

124
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,635
even in what was supposed to
be a difficult first year,

125
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:18,297
we were able to grow
really delicious vegetables.

126
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,711
I still remember it now.

127
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:27,908
Father looked really
happy that day.

128
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:37,757
That night, the man convinced
my unwilling father...

129
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,727
...and forced him
to expand the farm.

130
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:41,921
And then...

131
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,065
We had abnormal weather
conditions this year...

132
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,124
...and there were lots of pests.

133
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,770
Mr. Sekine...

134
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,706
We should've used pesticide.

135
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:57,176
We don't have room for that
kind of thing in our budget yet.

136
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:00,013
Necessity knows no law, right?

137
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:03,149
I imagine it's expensive...
Pesticide...

138
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,817
It's still not too late.

139
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:08,121
I'll let you have some
of the stuff I used to use.

140
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,622
R-Really?!

141
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,858
Please don't be shy.
Let's do our best!

142
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,883
Th-Thank you very much!

143
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:25,471
Father believed what
the man told him...

144
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,574
...and used the pesticide
every day,

145
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:29,906
but the vegetables kept dying
one after another.

146
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:39,341
It was around then that
Father started drinking again.

147
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:46,859
I still say it'd be better if
we consulted other people, too!

148
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,696
At this rate,
they're all really going to die!

149
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:53,333
It'll be okay. As long as
we do as Mr. Sekine says...

150
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,664
Father!

151
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:00,740
It'll be okay. No worries.

152
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,537
It'll be okay.

153
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:10,850
In the end, Father didn't
go consult anyone else...

154
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,683
...and kept on waiting for the
pesticide to start taking effect.

155
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,399
I wonder if he got lost
and wandered in here.

156
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,505
Oh, no! You can't lick that stuff!

157
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:43,483
What...

158
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,814
...does this mean?

159
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:47,811
Father?!

160
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:12,545
He told us it was a pesticide
that would kill the insects,

161
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:16,675
but he'd been giving us a solution
of just juice mixed with water.

162
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:23,523
Not knowing that, Father completely
believed it was real pesticide...

163
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:26,526
Why did that man
do something like that?

164
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:28,928
I heard about it
and found out later...

165
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:33,099
...that he used to be in a dispute with
Father's late uncle over this land.

166
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,090
It was revenge?

167
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:40,273
Why did Father have to die?

168
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:44,644
Moving in to a new house,
starting a new line of work...

169
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:47,306
We only wanted to live normally!

170
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:50,650
And that's why you accessed the site?

171
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,985
What?

172
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:54,646
The Hell Link site...

173
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,707
You were given a straw doll, right?

174
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:17,335
That you can get revenge
if you pull the thread?

175
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,850
I understand how you
feel really well,

176
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,852
but you shouldn't seek revenge!

177
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:26,819
Hajime!

178
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:27,911
Tsugumi, you be quiet!

179
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,259
Listen to me, Yuko.

180
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,697
If you pull that thread,
a person is going to be banished to Hell.

181
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:40,032
You may be able to get
your revenge that way,

182
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:42,468
but you'll have banished
someone to Hell.

183
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:45,238
That fact will never be erased.

184
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:48,366
You'll have to live with that
burden for the rest of your life.

185
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:54,035
You can see what a terrible
thing that would be, can't you?

186
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,451
I knew your father well.

187
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:01,154
He was always talking about you.

188
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,756
All he thought of was your happiness.

189
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:09,162
That's why I know that your
father wouldn't want revenge.

190
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,165
To say nothing of having you
live the rest of your life...

191
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:15,100
...with this guilt on your
shoulders for his sake.

192
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,337
This is sort of getting messed up...

193
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,254
Hajime!

194
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:37,623
I'll hold on to this.

195
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,614
Think this through carefully!

196
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,198
Hey, man, that's foul play,
isn't it?!

197
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,132
We'll just have to get it back.

198
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,744
Father...

199
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:10,838
Do I smell?

200
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:13,616
A little.

201
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,994
That wasn't fair.

202
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,597
Taking it away from
her was underhanded!

203
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,766
Yes, it might have
been underhanded.

204
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,567
But please understand.

205
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,070
I don't want Yuko
to seek out revenge.

206
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,371
I don't understand!

207
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:38,244
Yuko's father was practically
killed by that man!

208
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:40,413
See, Tsugumi,

209
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:42,949
there's a lot that happens in life.

210
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,619
And some of it's going to
be unbelievably unjust...

211
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,388
But you have to overcome
those things.

212
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,524
That's what it means to live.

213
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,093
So, it's okay even
if you get killed?

214
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,594
I never said that!

215
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:57,463
Yes, it's what you're saying!

216
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Why are you taking sides
with a bastard like that?!

217
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,468
He deserves to get sent to Hell!

218
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:06,405
Yuko's father never
did anything bad...

219
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:09,101
A bastard like that,
the sooner he dies the better!

220
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,684
You're so pigheaded, Hajime!

221
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:22,586
If you got killed,
Tsugumi would get revenge, too!

222
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,579
Tsugumi!

223
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:48,507
Miss.

224
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,306
Wanyuudou...

225
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:58,090
I didn't expect Tsugumi
to say something like that...

226
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,354
I wonder if it's my fault,
after all.

227
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:04,964
Rain?

228
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,634
Tsugumi!

229
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,042
Tsugumi!

230
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,086
Father...

231
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:39,098
Hell Girl!

232
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,766
What should I do?

233
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:45,135
I don't know. Please tell me!
What should I do?!

234
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:48,834
That is for you to decide.

235
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,649
I'm just not going to forgive him!

236
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,139
Not him!

237
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,575
Yuko!

238
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:38,858
Have you seen Tsugumi?

239
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,892
What?

240
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:41,760
I can't find her anywhere.

241
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,662
You can't go that way!

242
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,323
It's dangerous at night!

243
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,302
Tsugumi!

244
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:53,038
Tsugumi!

245
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,207
Tsugumi!

246
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,076
Tsugumi!

247
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,510
Oh! This is...

248
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,104
It's Tsugumi's.

249
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,441
Tsugumi!

250
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,490
Tsugumi!

251
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,156
Hajime...

252
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:26,372
You idiot!

253
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:28,607
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?!

254
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,131
And in this rain...

255
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:39,707
It's not like I asked you
to worry about me.

256
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,543
Tsugumi!

257
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:52,995
You idiot...

258
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,589
You made me so worried...

259
00:19:57,469 --> 00:20:01,307
I really was worried, you know...

260
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,968
Hajime...

261
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,427
You're not going to take revenge?

262
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:24,129
You're really okay with that?

263
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,065
Yeah.

264
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,967
I see. I'm glad.

265
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,903
You've gotta find happiness enough
for both you and your father.

266
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:33,405
Thank you.

267
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:36,772
Father, I'll do my best.

268
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:42,037
Not once, but twice...

269
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,751
So we never got our turn
in the spotlight.

270
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,743
We really have to do
something about that man.

271
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:53,392
What are you going to do now?

272
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:54,793
I don't know.

273
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:57,796
But I'm thinking of staying
here for a while.

274
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,264
Since I have a lot of memories
with my father here, too.

275
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:07,996
What do you want?!

276
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:12,845
He'd borrowed money with
this place as collateral?

277
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:15,848
I have his note right here, too.

278
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:19,918
It seems he had a lot of expenses
related to expanding the farm.

279
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:23,222
I told him I didn't need
anything of the sort,

280
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:26,592
but he insisted on it,
saying it wouldn't feel right otherwise.

281
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,727
That's a damn underhanded thing to do!

282
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:30,629
How far do you have to take
it before you're satisfied?!

283
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:33,932
Mr. Murai trusted you to the very end!

284
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:36,902
And yet, you...You call yourself human?!
You piece of scum!

285
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,233
Stop it!

286
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:42,634
It doesn't matter now.

287
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:48,814
Please move out as quickly as you can.

288
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:51,517
This place is a little more
cleaned up now,

289
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:54,042
so it should sell for a nice price.

290
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,886
Yuko...

291
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,130
Now, shall we go?

292
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:25,551
She should've pulled it, after all.

293
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:29,749
Then Yuko could've stayed
in that house...

294
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:38,130
It's your fault, you know, Hajime.

295
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,666
There's nothing for you
to worry about.

296
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,657
You'll make friends in no time.

297
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:52,934
Now, go on in.

298
00:22:56,115 --> 00:23:00,315
That is for you to decide.

299
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:20,068
Always a dead end

300
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:26,742
There is no escape

301
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:34,850
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

302
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,116
And I'll let it fly

303
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:47,529
This place is ephemeral

304
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:58,507
An eternity that binds me

305
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:05,514
Coming or going

306
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:17,085
All that passes by are dreams

307
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,335
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

308
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,239
There's a memory that
I can't forget.

309
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,409
There's a feeling that
I can't push away.

310
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,847
Tsugumi, I can't tell
you everything yet.

311
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,715
But please understand.

312
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,753
Revenge is wrong.

313
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,688
Hajime...

314
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:55,490
I don't think getting revenge
is a bad thing.

315
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,493
"Hell Girl
Rain of Remorse"
Next time, "Rain of Remorse".

316
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,993
"Hell Girl
Rain of Remorse"
