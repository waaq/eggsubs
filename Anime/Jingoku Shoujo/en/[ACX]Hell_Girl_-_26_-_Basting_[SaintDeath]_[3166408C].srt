1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:03,192
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,894
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,632
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:14,170
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,906
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,081
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

9
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:34,219
Kimi to kami o kiru kagami no naka

10
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,625
Jugyou-chuu no rouka hibiku ashioto

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,897
Taezu ame no oto ga tsuite-kuru yo

12
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:52,671
Kanjiru mama no katachi wa mabushii
amai hana ni naru

13
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,374
Doku no mi ni mo naru

14
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:58,110
Kyou mo ame

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,351
Ano hi to ima o
sora to sora de tsunagitai no

16
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,987
In this craziness, uncertainty

17
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:15,995
Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

18
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,764
In this craziness, you gave me life

19
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:26,605
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

20
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,274
In this craziness, uncertainty

21
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:37,416
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

22
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,052
In this craziness, you gave me life

23
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:48,323
Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

24
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,032
Ai...

25
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,368
You have committed a forbidden act.

26
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:04,572
You have opened the door to your
heart that you swore to keep shut.

27
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:08,843
You can no longer be entrusted
with this task.

28
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:12,413
You will return with me to Hell.

29
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,382
And...

30
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:17,044
...you will be punished for your sins.

31
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,588
I can't yet.

32
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,022
I cannot return to Hell.

33
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,996
That will not be permitted.

34
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:29,987
Now, you are going back.

35
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,704
No...

36
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,194
It's not over yet.

37
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:43,267
Ai, I will not permit you to go!

38
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,335
The Miss! She was all right!

39
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:08,803
Where is she going?

40
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,171
Retribution...

41
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,439
-Retribution?
-Retribution?

42
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,773
The Miss is still ruled
by a powerful hatred.

43
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:18,876
Miss...

44
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:23,251
Looks like we're being called on.

45
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,352
H-Hey!

46
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:25,683
Wanyuudou!

47
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:35,063
So you will go, after all.

48
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:38,429
Do you mean to go through
this again, Ai?

49
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:43,463
"The Ephemeral"

50
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,976
Why didn't Sentaro try to save Ai?

51
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,878
That's because...

52
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,580
You understand why, don't you, Hajime?

53
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,549
Because you said so.

54
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,541
Tell me. I want to hear it.

55
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,244
Hell Girl...

56
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,413
You want to hear, don't you?

57
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,981
What?

58
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,940
I'll tell you about your father.

59
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,422
Where's Hajime?!

60
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,083
Give Hajime back!

61
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,762
M-Mother?

62
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,616
I won't let you have Tsugumi.

63
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:10,483
What?

64
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:12,919
A woman like you...

65
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,021
I don't even want to see your face!

66
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,990
I want to start over.

67
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,660
How can I trust someone
who's already betrayed me once?!

68
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,996
I'm sorry...

69
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:25,532
I'm sorry, forgive me.

70
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:26,900
You must be joking!

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,904
You didn't just betray me!
You betrayed Tsugumi, too!

72
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:32,906
Go to that man!

73
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,568
Don't ever show your face
around us again!

74
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,302
Mother...

75
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,912
Get out of here!

76
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,955
Hajime...

77
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,990
M-Mother...

78
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,321
No...

79
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:29,525
No.

80
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,595
It's...

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,001
It's...

82
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,832
...not my fault...

83
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,053
What a bad man your father is.

84
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:57,323
It was his fault, and yet he
refused to acknowledge it.

85
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:58,491
It's...

86
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,360
...not my fault...

87
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,463
If your father had forgiven her,

88
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,599
your mother would not have had to die.

89
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,270
He could have saved her...

90
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,741
You must have been lonely
without your mother.

91
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,073
It must have been hard.

92
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:26,781
I will banish your father
to Hell for you.

93
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:33,960
Now, take it.

94
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,696
N... No!

95
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,357
I don't want it!

96
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,795
"Amano"

97
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:49,205
All that remains is for you to decide.

98
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,189
400 years?

99
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,160
Yeah, it's been about that long since
the Miss took up this task.

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,798
She had to do it, as her punishment.

101
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:13,129
Punishment...

102
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:23,243
A punishment she was
sentenced to in Hell, huh?

103
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,745
The Miss has done her best...

104
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:28,515
Long months and years, over the eras,

105
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:32,952
she's watched the result of the
grievances brought about by man.

106
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:35,922
She couldn't run away from it,
even if she wanted to.

107
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:39,259
Not as long as grievances existed.

108
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,262
Over the course of a mind-boggling
length of time,

109
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:45,265
the Miss has worked
to wash away her sins...

110
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:49,502
Forgetting her own grievance,
locking her emotions away.

111
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:54,674
But you two took her back to square one
in the blink of an eye.

112
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:58,077
That your ancestor was the object
of the Miss's vengeance...

113
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,413
You guys must've been shocked, too.

114
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,049
Talk about the worst karmic bond.

115
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,518
But why are you telling me this?

116
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,087
Weren't you ordered to watch me?

117
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,957
To be honest,
we don't know what to do anymore.

118
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,926
Yeah, we're powerless...

119
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,490
You there...

120
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,467
Hey, you there...

121
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,504
She's never spoken
to anyone but the Miss...

122
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:26,339
It looks like she means you.

123
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,174
What?

124
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,710
I'll let you out of here.

125
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,745
But in exchange...

126
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,615
Exchange?

127
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:39,107
There's something
I want you to do for me.

128
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,224
Mother...

129
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,168
You can just banish him.

130
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:04,140
You can just banish
the one you hate to Hell.

131
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:09,082
You've hated him all along, haven't you?

132
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:10,783
That was all a lie!

133
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,186
A world of lies that you created!

134
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,854
It's not the truth!

135
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:18,024
Even without knowing what happened then,

136
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:22,328
in your heart, you've hated
your father all this time.

137
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,964
You're wrong! I don't think that!

138
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:29,202
You think that it was your father's
fault that your mother died.

139
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,771
I don't think that!

140
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:32,805
It's...

141
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:34,295
...not my fault...

142
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,748
I don't... think that...

143
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,272
Why?

144
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:46,844
Why do you say such terrible things?

145
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:56,863
Wait! Give Hajime back!

146
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:59,195
Wait, Hell Girl!

147
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:07,831
Think well upon it, Tsugumi.

148
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:12,339
Nooo!

149
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:27,493
It's...

150
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:29,154
...not my fault...

151
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,027
Mother...

152
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:43,040
...in your heart, you've hated
your father all this time.

153
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,111
No...

154
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,718
Wh-What is it now?

155
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:12,939
If you really want retribution,

156
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,271
untie that red thread.

157
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,019
Tsugumi...

158
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,353
Mother...

159
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:33,226
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

160
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:37,864
The object of your vengeance
will immediately be banished to Hell.

161
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,032
However,

162
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:40,666
once you have your retribution,

163
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,500
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

164
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,974
Here, it's your favorite snack, Tsugumi.

165
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,050
Stop this...

166
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,719
Curses come home to roost.

167
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:04,156
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

168
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,766
You will never see Heaven,

169
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:20,840
and your soul will wander for
eternity in pain and agony.

170
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,575
Please, stop this...

171
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,511
Help me, Hajime...

172
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:26,813
It's...

173
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:28,474
...not my fault...

174
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:33,319
Tsugumi, it hurts... It hurts.

175
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,310
Stop this!

176
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:46,030
Your beloved father robbed you
of your mother.

177
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:51,270
It must be hard, Tsugumi.
It must be painful.

178
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,941
Your heart torn in two...

179
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,609
I'll help you.

180
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,678
You can escape this misery.

181
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,875
Pull the thread. Free your heart.

182
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,357
Don't suffer anymore.

183
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:13,689
I want to help you.

184
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:30,298
Tsugumi!

185
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:38,484
What did you try to make Tsugumi do?

186
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:40,008
Answer me, Ai Enma!

187
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,718
Miss.

188
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:47,450
Please stop this already, Miss!
Doing this won't...

189
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,229
Silence.

190
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,571
Let's get out of here, Tsugumi!

191
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,951
Wh-What's wrong, Tsugumi?

192
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:14,687
Poor Mother...

193
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,888
What?

194
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,423
Poor her...

195
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,091
Tsugumi...

196
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,293
That's right.

197
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,229
If only this man had forgiven her,

198
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:26,065
your mother would not have had to die.

199
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:29,001
Your mother would have
been with you, Tsugumi,

200
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,938
and you wouldn't have had to be lonely.

201
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:35,208
Stop this!
This has nothing to do with you!

202
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,870
Do you really think so?

203
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:50,512
Th-This can't be...

204
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,195
Your poor mother.

205
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:58,220
All because of that man...

206
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,724
You must pass judgment on him.

207
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:13,342
No...

208
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:17,580
No.

209
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,049
It's...

210
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,588
It's me that should've died.

211
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:33,299
I trusted her...

212
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,462
I couldn't forgive her!
I was so angry, I couldn't help myself!

213
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:42,808
Tsugumi, I'm sorry! It's my fault!

214
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:47,013
It's all my fault that your mother died!

215
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,681
Forgive me!

216
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,317
It's too late to apologize now.

217
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,954
What has already happened
cannot be undone.

218
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:59,625
I know. I know. I was an idiot.

219
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,894
Regret is meaningless.

220
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:04,697
What has been lost will
never be restored.

221
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:08,463
Untie the thread. I will avenge you.

222
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,005
Ayumi...

223
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:17,109
I loved you. I adored your smile.

224
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,012
That's why I worked so hard.

225
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:24,350
But b-because of that,
I left you feeling lonely...

226
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,887
In your desire for affection,
you made a mistake...

227
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,723
And I couldn't forgive you for that.

228
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:34,921
Not only that, but I thought
you deserved to die for it...

229
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:40,566
I never thought that would
really come to pass...

230
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:44,058
I just couldn't accept it...

231
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:06,459
l-I've always caused nothing but trouble
for the people I care about.

232
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,761
Always hurt them...

233
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,162
I'm to blame.

234
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,831
It must have been hard
for you, too, Tsugumi.

235
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,699
It must have been so lonely.

236
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,259
Now, untie the thread!

237
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,096
Tsugumi, do it.

238
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:29,815
You dummy, what are you saying?

239
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,984
You dummy!

240
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:35,020
I never once thought it was hard!

241
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,156
I was happy being with you, Hajime!

242
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:42,094
Because I love you, I was happy!

243
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,095
Tsugumi...

244
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:45,398
Why would you say things like that?

245
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,700
Weren't you happy, Hajime?

246
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,137
When you laughed with me,
was that all a lie?!

247
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:56,675
Having our meals, watching TV,
going out shopping...

248
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:59,812
There were times when I was lonely
because Mother wasn't around,

249
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:05,584
but Hajime... Father,
because I had you, I was all right.

250
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,320
It wasn't hard.

251
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,459
Was it hard for you to be with me?
Were you not happy?

252
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,428
Tsugumi...

253
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:18,063
Tell me...

254
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:21,567
Yeah, I was happy.

255
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:25,204
Just being with you, I was...

256
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:28,073
...able to feel blessed.

257
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:29,809
Really?

258
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,310
Really.

259
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,507
Okay. I'm so glad.

260
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,423
You're just Ai.

261
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,047
I don't need this.

262
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:22,127
You loved him, didn't you?
Loved Sentaro?

263
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:26,065
He loved you all along, too.

264
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,934
That's why he always regretted it.

265
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,061
So he built that temple...

266
00:20:58,764 --> 00:20:59,865
Where...

267
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,856
Shichidouji, where we started.

268
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,036
Miss!

269
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:36,765
Ai...

270
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:39,668
Miss...

271
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,642
We're going.

272
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,711
Come.

273
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,576
Yes, Miss.

274
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:08,500
Why did she burn the temple?

275
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,161
Ai Enma was...

276
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,202
Nah, it's nothing.

277
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,843
Thank you, Tsugumi.

278
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:22,848
Let's go home.

279
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:24,450
Yeah.

280
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,720
Don't leave me alone ever again, okay?

281
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,348
Yeah, I promise.

282
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:54,108
Itsudatte yukidomari de

283
00:22:54,108 --> 00:23:00,782
Keshite nigerarenai

284
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:08,890
Sora no tori e kanashimi nose

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,224

Sugite yuku wa yume

290
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,492
All that remains is for you to decide.

291
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,334
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

292
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,171
You know what they say about
all that ends well.

293
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,974
Once the wound closes, that's it.

294
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,910
But before you know it,

295
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,147
you're suffering again in a similar
way from a fresh wound.

296
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:47,451
Ultimately, there is no such
thing as the end.

297
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:51,722
Humans are such utterly
pitiful creatures.

298
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:54,525
Eh, Miss?

299
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,626
The fresh wounds will be even more...

300
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,061
"It will continue..."
The fresh wounds will be even more...

301
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,096
"It will continue..."
"Hell Girl"
The fresh wounds will be even more...

302
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,596
"It will continue..."
"Hell Girl"
