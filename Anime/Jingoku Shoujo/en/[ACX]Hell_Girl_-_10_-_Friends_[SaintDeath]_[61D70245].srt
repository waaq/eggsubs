00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:04,861
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,997
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:09,599
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,137
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,873
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:20,172
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,052
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

8
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:34,191
Kimi to kami o kiru kagami no naka

00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:39,596

Ano hi to ima o

15
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,958
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:15,966
Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

17
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,735
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:26,576
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa

19
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,246
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:37,387
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa
dokoka ni nokoseru darou ka

21
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,023
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:48,294
Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa
doko made mamoreru darou ka

23
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:54,471
You're lying!

24
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,439
It's not a lie!

25
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,308
Here, take a look at this picture.

26
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,606
Holy crap, you're right!

27
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:05,248
Sho! I love you, Sho!

28
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,983
He's not going to hear you.

29
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:09,052
I was listening to him
talking to the store clerk

30
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,620
and it sounded like
he's a regular customer!

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,123
What?! Then let's all
go together next time!

32
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,891
Even if we have to skip class!

33
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,960
What about you, Shiori?

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,162
Huh? Of course!

35
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:24,267
And it seems like other celebrities
go there pretty often, too.

36
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:27,236
So it's famous among
certain groups of fans.

37
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,441
Why do you look at me like that?

38
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,711
If you want friends,
you could go find someone else.

39
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:39,182
Hey, hey, have you decided
who you want in your school trip group?

40
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,583
What's wrong with us sticking together?

41
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,118
We can just stick together.

42
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,085
Right.

43
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:45,922
I won't forgive you.

44
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:47,822
I'll never forgive you.

45
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,200
How's school? Are you working hard?

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,302
Of course, she's working hard.

47
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:02,339
After all, she was able to
transfer in to her dream school.

48
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,807
Right, Minami?

49
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,108
Y-Yeah.

50
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,978
That reminds me, Shiori hasn't
come by to hang out lately.

51
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,380
I wonder what's the matter.

52
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,779
She says she's busy.

53
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,430
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

54
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:35,905
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

55
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:41,978
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Shiori Akasaka
Send"

56
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:43,172
"Send"

57
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:01,131
You seem to get more
and more of them every day.

58
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,799
I guess so.

59
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,070
Don't they have anyone they
can go talk to or something?

60
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,231
Like friends...

61
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:12,742
I guess not.

62
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:17,772
"Friends"

63
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,910
Who are you?

64
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,278
You summoned me, remember?

65
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,979
I am Ai Enma.

66
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,749
You're Hell Girl, aren't you?! You came!

67
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,046
Thank you!

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,810
Take it.

69
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,517
O-Okay.

70
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:44,065
If you really want retribution,

71
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,735
untie that red thread.

72
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:51,806
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

73
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:55,977
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

74
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,179
All right.

75
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,616
You should think this through carefully.

76
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,084
I have thought about it.

77
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:06,688
I thought about it a lot and
I decided this was the only way!

78
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:08,456
Once you have your retribution,

79
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:12,260
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,629
Curses come home to roost.

81
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,123
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

82
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,465
Though, that's only after you die.

83
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,737
But...

84
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,742
My life right now is Hell anyway!

85
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,749
If I'm going to do this, I'll do it
in front of her eyes instead of here.

86
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:44,359
What kind of look will she have
on her face when she's sent to Hell?

87
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,621
It'll be a sight to see.

Morning!

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,136
The hairstylist there is so cool!

91
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,763
I'm thinking about going there
on a regular basis.

92
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,713
What's that smirk on her face?
It gives me the creeps.

93
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:11,753
Shiori, I guess it'll be goodbye
when school lets out today.

94
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:14,689
A lot has happened up until now, but...

95
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,292
Hey, hey, what's the
transfer student like?

96
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,259
Here she comes!

98
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,598
Hi!

99
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,067
Are you enrolling in
the middle school here?

100
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,001
What?

101
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,771
I'm Shiori Akasaka and
I'm in the elementary division.

102
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:30,672
Nice to meet you.

103
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:33,007
Oh, um, I'm...

104
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,237
I guess we'll be in the
same grade starting in April.

105
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,637
I'm Minami Shibuya.

106
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,987
See? Isn't this band great?

107
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:49,891
Yeah, but I've never heard of this band.

108
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:54,596
Not here. But over there,
they're incredibly popular!

109
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,723
And their lyrics are really great, too!

110
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,402
It's English. I can't understand it.

111
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,370
I'll translate it for you sometime.

112
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,778
I thought we were great friends,

113
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,871
until that happened...

00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:32,267
I'm sorry for being late, Shiori.

118
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,669
You're a lifesaver!

119
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:39,231
The other subjects are fine,
but English has me worried...

120
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,609
What is it?

121
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,136
I'm sorry, Minami. I can't
walk home with you today.

122
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,450
I-I see.

123
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,821
Your English is what they
call "Queen's English", right?

124
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,589
Yup.

125
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,293
Your house is big, right?
I can't wait to see it!

126
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,727
It's not that big a deal.

132
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:38,032
PE is such a drag.

133
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,701
And the teacher's so stuffy.

134
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,003
She's looking at me again.

135
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,471
Do you want to make me suffer that much?

136
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,809
Just like that time.

137
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,510
That's stalking!

That's stalking!

It is?

140

It is?

141
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:51,713
"Ebisu's class is so...

It is!

142
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:51,980
"Just Earlier

It is!

143
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,814
"Just Earlier

She e-mails you every 30 minutes, right?

144
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:53,948
"That reminds me...

She e-mails you every 30 minutes, right?

145
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:54,048
"You know...

She e-mails you every 30 minutes, right?

146
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,116

Without a doubt!

147
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:55,984
"You know...

She's definitely a stalker!

148
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:56,317
She's definitely a stalker!

149
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,886
What? What do you think I should do?

150
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,755
Go talk to the teacher.

151
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,590
Oh, right.

152
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,626
I'll do that.

153
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,893
I see.

154
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:09,998
All right, I'll talk to Shibuya
and tell her to stop.

155
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,265
I'd appreciate that, Mr. Ebisu.

00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,456
Hey, Shiori...

161
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,262
I want to talk to you about something.

162
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:44,032
Sorry, I don't.

163
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,366
What are you doing?

164
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,168
Shiori, you've got the wrong idea.

165
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,936
I'm not really...

166
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,597
Let go!

167
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,243
Shiori!

168
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:56,711
Are you okay, Shiori?

169
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:58,813
Yeah, but...

170
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:02,984
Oh, man! Wax stains
don't come out, you know!

171
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,586
Shiori, I really...

172
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,689
What are you trying to do to Akasaka?

173
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,792
Sheesh! This is the
problem with stalkers.

174
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,593
I'll take care of you!

175
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,584
I'm not a stalker!

176
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:20,234
Shiori, I want you to believe that,
even if no one else does!

177
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,936
Don't be ridiculous!

178
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:24,461
Don't make me suffer any more
than you already have!

179
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,945
-Here we go!
-Pass! Pass!
-Pass! Pass!

180
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:35,883
If everyone wants to ignore me,
then that's fine.

181
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,652
-Rebound!
-Over here! Rebound, rebound, rebound!

182
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,552
I'm used to it now.

183
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:44,723
Shiori, you will pay
for doing that to me.

184
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,353
Just quit it already!

185
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,090
Hey, nice shot!

186
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,336
Don't look at me like that...

187
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:57,099
-Shiori!
-What?!

188
00:10:58,306 --> 00:10:59,507
Are you okay?!

189
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:00,775
Y-Yeah...

190
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,177
-Why don't you go to the nurse's office?
-Okay.

191
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,646
"Nurse's Office"

192
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:07,671
"Nurse's Office"
Thank you very much.

193
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:25,227
Come to think of it,
I wonder what that thing was.

194
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:48,589
What the?

195
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:50,057
What is this?

196
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,593
Does she plan to curse me
to death with this?!

197
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:55,129
Is my sprained finger
because of a curse, too?

198
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,562
This is so stupid!

199
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,959
If that's how you want to play this,
then I can play, too!

200
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,873
It's not here! It's not here!
It's not here!

201
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,883
If we don't hurry,
the co-op's going to get busy.

202
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:16,872
Right.

203
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,918
Where did it go?

204
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:38,105
Accepted.

205
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,308
Um, by the way...

206
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:43,177
Would you care for more coffee?

207
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,145
Oh, no, thank you.

208
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,583
Um...

209
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,918
Could I get you to sign this receipt?

210
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:54,355
And a note stating that you
won't publicize this incident...

211
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,257
Huh?

212
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,852
Oh, well, as insurance, just in case.

213
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,665
Well, I don't mind.

214
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,935
Though, I doubt you'll
have much use for it.

215
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:09,197
Please do.

216
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:54,815
What's wrong?

217
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,085
Oh, no, it's nothing.

218
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,781
Oh, please make sure to pick up the tab.

219
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,394
Looks like I've lost her.

220
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,747
Stalker! Stalker! Stalker!

221
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:30,818
Stalker! Stalker! Stalker!

222
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:34,254
Minami, you're the one
who's going to be cursed!

223
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,167
Good grief.

224
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,869
Talk about bad luck for Wanyuudou.

225
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,504
No kidding.

226
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,173
She might've come to the shrine
(This is a traditional
way of to curse someone to death.)

227
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,507
To lay a curse in the hour of the Ox,
(This is a traditional
way of to curse someone to death.)

228
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:55,276
But she used a normal nail
instead of a spike.
(This is a traditional
way of to curse someone to death.)

229
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:58,713
I guess kids these days don't
even know the proper protocol.

230
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,015
I feel sorry for you,
so I'll pull it out for you.

231
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,812
Much appreciated.

232
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,786
Wait.

233
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:06,620
What?

234
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,090
What is it, Miss?

235
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,992
Aren't we going to retrieve him?

236
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,728
No, let's leave things
the way they are for a while.

237
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:15,127
What?

238
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:19,800
But that girl Minami...

239
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,928
What'll she do now that
she's lost her black straw doll?

240
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:34,382
Minami's got a cold?

241
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:37,579
Yes, she said she's not
going to school today.

242
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,186
Maybe this is a message from God.

243
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:46,989
Maybe this is a divine message
telling me to stop seeking revenge.

244
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,303
Is this the effect of the curse?

245
00:15:56,303 --> 00:16:00,207
If it is, then that straw doll's amazing!

246
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:03,244
But she couldn't possibly be dead, right?

247
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:06,680
No, there's no reason
for me to let it bother me.

248
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,418
After all, she's the one who started it.

249
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,285
"July 12
School Trip
Day 1"

250
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:12,953
"July 12
School Trip
Day 1"
So that's the schedule.

251
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,387
"July 12
School Trip
Day 1"
Everyone split up into groups of three.

252
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:22,063
Oh, Shiori, what are
you doing over here?

253
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,330
We're full already.

254
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,966
What? But we said we'd be together...

255
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:26,834
The other day...

256
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,103
What? Didn't we tell you?

257
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:32,573
That we'd be teaming up with Ueno?

258
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,835
-Right?!
-Right?!
-Right?!

259
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:43,651
What?!

260
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:45,686
"E-mails Received
I want to see you...
Shiori"

261
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,188
"E-mails Received
I want to see you...
Shiori"
"I want to see you..."

262
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,349
Wh-What's going on?

263
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,194
"I'm really sorry about everything
from before... So, be my friend again.
Shiori"

264
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:54,762
"I'm really sorry about everything
from before... So, be my friend again.
Shiori"
"I'm really sorry

265
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:55,996
"I'm really sorry about everything
from before... So, be my friend again.
Shiori"
about everything from before...

266
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:56,497
about everything from before...

267
00:16:56,497 --> 00:17:00,991
So, be my friend again."

268
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,473
Shiori!

269
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,641
I'm sorry, too, Shiori!

270
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,943
I must have been crazy!

271
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:11,846
Thinking of trying to send you to Hell!

272
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

273
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:39,263
Shiori...

274
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,317
They're all mean.

275
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:53,621
Just when I needed them,
they left me out in the cold.

276
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,823
I was being tricked...

277
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,825
I was being tricked.

278
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,393
I see...

279
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:01,629
Minami...

280
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:06,367
You're my only real friend, Minami.

281
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,801
Forgive me for the way I've been.

282
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:12,904
Be my friend again.

283
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,916
Okay.

284
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,646
Really? You're really sure it's okay?!

285
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm sure.

286
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,745
Oh, this is...

287
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:32,689
Why do you have this?

288
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,763
I'm sorry, Minami.

289
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:37,196
This is...

290
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,700
It's okay.

291
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,635
It doesn't matter anymore.

292
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,000
Minami!

293
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,043
Shiori...

294
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:52,213
My, my, are they making up?

295
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,516
That was an unexpected conclusion,
wasn't it, Miss?

296
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,484
Don't you want to
see this through to the end?

297
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,115
I wonder if she hates happy endings.

298
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,494
Let's use this.

299
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:08,796
For what?

300
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,298
To curse everyone in the class.

301
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:17,638
What? Oh, but this isn't
an ordinary straw doll.

302
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:18,973
What do you mean?

303
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:22,676
Rather than nailing it,
you pull this red thread.

304
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:25,045
Then your target goes to Hell...

305
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,948
Oh, no, um...

306
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:29,917
Oh, then...

307
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,151
Wait!

308
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:32,052
Why?

309
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:35,783
The person who pulls it...
well, has to be me.

310
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:38,759
Then, here.

311
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,727
What?

312
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,762
Do it!

313
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:42,696
But...

314
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:44,365
I said, do it!

315
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:45,599
But...

316
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,168
Do it!

317
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:50,704
I'm asking you to do it, so do it!

318
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,706
I've found her! It's that girl!

319
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:54,408
Come on, do it!

320
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,377
Th-The thing is...

321
00:19:56,377 --> 00:20:00,147
With this, the one who does it
goes to Hell after she dies, too...

322
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:01,282
What?

323
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,916
So, I can't...

324
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,318
So?

325
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:06,120
So what?

326
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,889
So... So...

327
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,949
I... I can't...

328
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,235
Say, we're friends, right?

329
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:24,505
Or am I wrong?

330
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,507
Y-Yeah...

331
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,109
We're real friends, right?

332
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:31,078
Yeah...

333
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:35,310
If you're a real friend,
you'll do it for me, right?

334
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:42,887
Or aren't you my real friend?

335
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:48,362
I-I'm your friend...

336
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:51,131
Then...

337
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,860
Then!

338
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:08,573
Tell me, Shiori, are we really friends?

339
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:18,225
Your grievance has been heard.

340
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,249
Wha?!

341
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,502
Minami! Minami!

342
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:31,939
Minami, where are you?!
What is this place?!

343
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,804
No!

344
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:46,153
I-It's not... It's not my fault...

345
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:47,788
It is your fault.

346
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,823
No...

347
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:53,190
This is the world of hatred
that you wished for.

348
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:56,430
It is?

349
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,265
Maybe it is.

350
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,096
Maybe that's true.

351
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,138
But it was Shiori's fault.

352
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,698
Just because she's my friend
doesn't mean she had the right.

353
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,736
Consider my feelings, too...

354
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:24,491
You...

355
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,995
Where did that girl,
who was with you, go?

356
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,830
Probably Hell.

357
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,990
What?

358
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,335
But it's okay.

359
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:38,065
Because I'll be going there someday, too.

360
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:49,679
Be my friend over there, too, Shiori.

Masaya Kataoka.

374
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:37,520
You were used?

375
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,290
The truth, my ass!
Freedom of the press, my ass!

376
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,460
My family lost everything
because of those things!

377
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,428
It's unforgivable!

378
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,229
Your wish?

379
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:50,900
