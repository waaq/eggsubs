1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,895
It is said that life's
encounters are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,633
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,171
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,907
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:20,206
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:29,085
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,257
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,629
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,901
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:52,676
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:55,378
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,114
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:05,355
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,991
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:15,966
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,768
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:26,610
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,279
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:37,387
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,056
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:48,293
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,984
What do you think, Tsugumi?

24
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,219
Is this the view you saw?

25
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,555
Looks like it.

26
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:16,920
I see.

27
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:23,029
Sightseeing? Probably not, right?

28
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,665
Oh, are you from the island?

29
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:29,869
The guidebook said that island is a
place noted in connection with Heike.

30
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:33,940
Well, that's true,
but it's not much of a place.

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,209
All we get are visitors coming to fish.

32
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,979
Maybe a diver once in a while.
It's pretty quiet, sadly.

33
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,607
Well, that's the sort of island it is.

34
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,419
I wonder what they've come for.

35
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,320
Strangers with empty hands...

36
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,318
I see.

37
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:02,762
"Island Woman"

38
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,301
"Minato Inn"

39
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:16,969
Mina!

40
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:20,639
Where are you going, Mina?

41
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,997
Mina!

42
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,283
"Welcome to Sarutsuki Island"

43
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:11,998
Yesterday, the day before yesterday...

44
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:13,866
Who could she be waiting for?

45
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,501
I wonder if it's a sweetheart.

46
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,628
Who knows?

47
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,442
It's that man again!

48
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,910
What's he doing way out here?

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,048
Yuji!

50
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:30,183
Yuji...

51
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,186
Mina! You came to pick me up?

52
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,055
But I didn't tell you I was getting
out of the hospital today...

53
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,989
I need to talk to you.

54
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,261
Hajime, that's her!

55
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:54,336
All right. Come on.

56
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:58,544
So her name's Mina, huh?

57
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,481
Aww, I wanted to see the romance!

58
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,949
It's no fair, the Miss gets all the fun!

59
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:10,690
Wouldn't know.

60
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,126
And it's such a small island, too.

61
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:15,762
Well, we'll just move on.

62
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:18,364
I've never seen her.

63
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:20,628
I'm busy right now.

64
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:25,972
I don't know.

65
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,303
You'll have to ask someone else.

66
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:36,382
Hajime, are you really
a professional reporter?

67
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,646
Well, it can be like this at the start.

68
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:45,291
He's pretty tenacious.

69
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,988
Oh, if it's Mina Minato...

70
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm sorry, I have to
take care of something.

71
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,402
Have you hit a slump lately?

72
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:59,672
Where did you learn a word like that?

73
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,641
"Diner"

74
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,243
"Diner"
Wow, a special feature on the island!

75
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,947
Then you'll be mentioning our
place in the magazine, too?

76
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,949
Yes, well...

77
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,319
Then have a taste of all
of our specialty items!

78
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,822
Our specialty monkey parfait,
special monkey ice cream,

79
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,790
and monkey dumplings with ice cream!

80
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,592
I don't want them.

81
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:24,263
So, Mina is the daughter at the inn
at the edge of the harbor?

82
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:27,266
Don't you go talking about
unnecessary things now.

83
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,435
Yeah...

84
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:33,406
Speaking of which, she isn't
the daughter to be precise.

85
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:37,243
I think she's the niece of Fujie,
the proprietress.

86
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,911
What about her real mother?

87
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:42,381
As I recall, her name's
Satsuki and she passed away.

88
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,583
When?

89
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,318
This isn't good. What're we going to do?

90
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:46,808
Leave it to me.

91
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:52,646
I think that was about 15 years ago.

92
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,462
She threw herself into the ocean.

93
00:06:56,462 --> 00:07:00,099
Mind you, her body never washed up, but...

94
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,834
Why did she kill herself?

95
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,503
She left the island at one point,

96
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:07,039
and Mina was born between her
and a man she met over there, but...

97
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,442
Fujie...

98
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:13,936
In the end, the man left her
and she came back to the island.

99
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,720
I wish I'd never left the island.

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,356
It was just like you said, Fujie.

101
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,891
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,659
It's okay, Sister.

103
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,957
We'll be together again from now on.

104
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:34,367
But I guess it must have been
a shock to her, after all.

105
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:39,634
In the end, about two years later,
she left Mina and...

106
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,973
And then?

107
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,471
P-Please leave!

108
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,516
What was up with that?

109
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,451
I'm telling you, you're in a slump.

110
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,318
You keep saying it's a slump,
but come on!

111
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,025
It's a tiny island,
so the rumor will spread

112
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,926
and I doubt anyone else
will talk to him now.

113
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,330
Serves him right.

114
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,599
When you're in a slump,
you should quietly...

115
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,762
No way! I'm not giving up yet!

116
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,341
"Minato Inn"

117
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,776
"Minato Inn"
Sister, I don't want Mina to suffer
the heartache that you did.

118
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:21,509
Sister, I don't want Mina to suffer
the heartache that you did.

119
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:26,611
I'm doing various things with that
in mind, but she won't understand.

120
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:33,993
What do you think I should do, Sister?

121
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,824
Sister...

122
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,500
It was the same with me.

123
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,472
I had a hard time winning
the trust of the islanders.

124
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,274
Impressive.

125
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:53,980
So, Mr. Principal, are things not
going well between Mina and her aunt?

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,382
Things used to be good before.

127
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,785
Anyone would have thought they
were a real mother and daughter.

128
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:01,320
But then...

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,191
During middle school and high school,
Minato used to commute by boat,

130
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,526
but she was forced to
drop out of high school.

131
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,928
Why?

132
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,631
There's no need for an academic degree
to take over the inn...

133
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,833
Was that what she wanted?

134
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,134
No!

135
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:20,006
I felt very bad for her, so I went
to talk her aunt out of it,

136
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,141
but I wasn't able to manage that.

137
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:26,145
Minato was indebted to her
for her upbringing,

138
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,880
so she reluctantly went along with it.

139
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,548
Poor girl.

140
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,584
I learned about this later, but...

141
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:32,418
Yes?

142
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:39,825
It seems a boy from her high school
had called by phone to ask her out.

143
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,829
The aunt apparently
found that unforgivable.

144
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,564
That's terrible.

145
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:49,802
Incidentally, do you know
a young man named Yuji?

146
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:52,202
Oh, you must mean Numata.

147
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,575
He works for the prefecture's
Department of Fisheries.

148
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,512
He's studying the island's
fishing resources and such.

149
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,580
Is he seeing Mina?

150
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,979
Yes.

151
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:08,483
Does Fujie know about that?

152
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:14,656
Well, I suppose it's what people
call a woman's intuition...

153
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,898
Why can't I see Yuji?!

154
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,900
Because he's not from this island?!

155
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,636
It's too late if you wait
until you get hurt!

156
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,405
That's just an idea that
you've got stuck in your head!

157
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,441
No. Sister also...

158
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,043
Your mother also thinks the same!

159
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:33,546
Everyone that leaves this
island is met with misfortune!

160
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,247
I don't want you to suffer that!

161
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,415
That's why!

162
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,007
That's why!!

163
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,356
Mina, do you realize
what you're saying?

164
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,351
This injury from 3 days ago was...

165
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:53,859
It was probably a poacher.

166
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,536
You're wrong.

167
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:59,505
My aunt did it.

168
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,941
Just what basis do you
have for saying that?

169
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,476
I saw her!

170
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,078
That day, I heard groaning
from the bathing area,

171
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,978
so I went to find out
what was going on.

172
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,587
At the time, it didn't
make any sense to me.

173
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:18,858
But I remembered that you said
you'd been slashed with a knife...

174
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,826
Mina, what are you doing?!

175
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,161
It was you, wasn't it?!

176
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,763
You attacked Yuji!

177
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,164
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:27,967
Don't play dumb!

179
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,662
It is for your own good.

180
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,996
That's ridiculous...

181
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,340
So...

182
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,186
What is this?

183
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,888
"Audiovisual Room"

184
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,753
"Conserve Electricity"

185
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:00,433
"Fujie Minato"

186
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,457
"Send"

187
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,738
Hajime, this is the place!

188
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,468
This is where that girl
was standing last night!

189
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,412
Get away from there, Tsugumi!

190
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:14,310
What?

191
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,978
Hell Link?

192
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,981
This is the only choice we have left.

193
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,337
If you had only come earlier,

194
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:42,174
we could have prepared some
delicious seafood for you.

195
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:45,077
Um, so where is Mina tonight?

196
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:47,613
She went out during the day
and she has yet to return...

197
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:51,817
But I'm amazed you tracked her down
over a grade school composition.

198
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:56,589
I've been a judge for a long time,
but Mina's work was exceptional!

199
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,657
Oh, my. Really?

200
00:12:58,657 --> 00:12:59,492
Yes!

201
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:03,863
Mina still has the certificate
from that hanging in her room.

202
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,831
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

203
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:07,958
Well, then, please make
yourselves at home.

204
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,673
I guess checking her out ahead of
time was the right thing to do.

205
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,141
Right?

206
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:21,013
But from the looks of it, she didn't
seem like such a bad person.

207
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:25,384
Maybe she's done some extreme
things because she cares about Mina,

208
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:28,649
but it might be possible to work
it out with some persuasion.

209
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,592
I want to meet with her
as soon as possible...

210
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,321
Where'd she go?

211
00:13:58,717 --> 00:13:59,718
Tsugumi!

212
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,854
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

213
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,857
What's wrong, Tsugumi?!

214
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,158
What will you do?

215
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,284
What?

216
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:12,798
Will you untie it?
Will you not untie it?

217
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:16,702
Don't tell me it's...Hell Girl...

218
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,305
But something like this is...

219
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,606
It's bad luck!

220
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:21,674
Don't!

221
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:22,808
But...

222
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,611
If we don't do anything, there's no
knowing what she might do to us!

223
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,080
Next time, it could be
worse than just an injury!

224
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,516
Still...

225
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:34,286
Whether you throw it off the cliff
or you untie the thread...

226
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,088
...is up to you.

227
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,385
The rocky cliffs?!

228
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,492
What could be going on?

229
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:41,823
Let's follow him.

230
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:00,613
All right.

231
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,274
Let's untie it.

232
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,956
Okay, I'm untying it.

233
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:11,924
Okay.

234
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,392
Hey, you two!

235
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,292
Y-Yes?!

236
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,665
Wh-What is it?

237
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,433
You're Mina and Yuji, right?

238
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,869
W-We haven't done anything yet!

239
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,204
Where's the straw doll?!

240
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,673
What did you do with
the black straw doll?!

241
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,074
What are you talking about?

242
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,644
You haven't untied
the thread yet, right?!

243
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,412
Please, think this over one more time!

244
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,314
You can still turn back!

245
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,216
If you make a hasty
decision to untie it,

246
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,051
there'll be no taking it back!

247
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:39,985
What?

248
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:42,321
Oh, goodness!
It looks like we're too late.

249
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,957
I don't think we can
get involved this time.

250
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,558
If you untie that thread,

251
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:49,595
you'll end up weighed down with a
burden that's far too heavy for you!

252
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:50,896
Are you fine with that?

253
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,989
You two want to find happiness, right?

254
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,367
Yeah.

255
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,769
I'm telling you right now.

256
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,570
No matter what there might be,

257
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,241
you'll never find happiness by
bringing grief to someone else!

258
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,443
So don't be rash!

259
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,775
Uh, um...

260
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,948
I was married once before
and I'm saying this,

261
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,083
so you know I'm right!

262
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,516
Believe me!

263
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,655
Thank you very much.

264
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:19,792
You two understand, then?

265
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:23,796
For being so concerned about
a couple of strangers like us.

266
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:24,897
Right?

267
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:26,331
That's true.

268
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:29,101
Truly, thank you very much.

269
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:32,304
Nah, I'm just happy you understand.

270
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,573
But what'll we do, Yuji?

271
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:38,634
My aunt isn't the sort of
person you can reason with...

272
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:44,149
Oh, I know! Why don't
we just go and elope?!

273
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,584
Elope?!

274
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,219
Elope, huh?

275
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,688
Hey, now, that's not good!

276
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,857
Yeah! I hadn't thought of that!

277
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:52,558
Yeah!

278
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,126
Now, calm down!

279
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,629
Do you two even have any prospect
of making a living after you elope?!

280
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,465
But your aunt...

281
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,867
I'm sure she'll understand someday!

282
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,236
When she does, all three of us can...

283
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,070
That's true.

284
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,638
Come on, listen to what I'm saying!

285
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,307
Thank you very much!

286
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,604
H-Hey!

287
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,944
Good grief. I guess that
wasn't really like me.

288
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:21,920
"Don't be rash!
You only have one precious life!"

289
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,288
"Don't be rash!
You only have one precious life!"
Owowow...

290
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:23,589
Owowow...

291
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,190
Damn it!

292
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,030
I saw this show last week.

293
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,999
Hajime sure is taking a long time.

294
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,069
Oh?

295
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,627
It's Mina.

296
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,299
Mina...

297
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:55,987
Mina doesn't listen
to me at all anymore...

298
00:17:57,189 --> 00:18:00,317
What should I do, Sister?

299
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,697
I'm sorry, Fujie...

300
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:09,568
...for foisting off Mina on you.

301
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,593
Mother?!

302
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,602
Mother, you're alive?

303
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,002
If only I weren't in this
wretched condition...

304
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:48,540
Don't. We agreed we wouldn't talk
about that, remember, Sister?

305
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,242
You're right.

306
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:53,302
I'll try talking to Mina myself.

307
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,599
Mina...

308
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,501
Wh-What is that?

309
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,337
What are you saying?

310
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:21,006
It's your mother.

311
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:21,707
-As you can see,
I've been unable to move...

312
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,675
-What?
-As you can see,
I've been unable to move...

313
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:26,044
Wh-Where is her voice coming from?

314
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:30,115
It was Sister's...
It was your mother's fault.

315
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,551
Fujie, stop this! Please don't do this!

316
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,557
Why are you doing this terrible thing?!

317
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,259
That's what I want to know!

318
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,827
After the terrible experience
you went through,

319
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,463
why are you trying to
leave the island again?!

320
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:47,566
I hate this island!

321
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,735
Don't say that, Sister.

322
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,537
This is the island where
we were born and raised.

323
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,907
But I'm still leaving! Don't stop me!

324
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,943
Why won't you understand, Sister?!

325
00:19:57,943 --> 00:20:01,513
I won't let you go!
Be with me forever, Sister!

326
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,640
Nooo!

327
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,019
Y-You're terrible...

328
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,489
Mina, you mustn't blame your aunt.

329
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:15,394
She's doing everything with
our best interests at heart.

330
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:18,130
I'm so glad to hear that, Sister.

331
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,429
From now on, the three of us
will be happy together.

332
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,804
S-Stop this, Auntie!

333
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:28,329
Please, don't do this!

334
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,673
Be good now.

335
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,452
Mina...

336
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,454
The three of us are going to get along...

337
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:45,824
...and live on this island, Mina.

338
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:47,626
Mina!

339
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,150
Please stop this!

340
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:50,963
The hell are you doing?!

341
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:51,930
Please calm down!

342
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,198
Shuddup!

343
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:54,688
Yuji!

344
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,868
Anyone who gets in the way...

345
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:04,307
...of our happiness...

346
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,645
Nooo!

347
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:14,149
Your grievance has been heard.

348
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,654
Why...

349
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,678
I love you, Sister.

350
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:43,512
We'll be together forever. Forever...

351
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,519
How sad.

352
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,355
If you close yourself off,
you leave yourself with no escape...

353
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:59,695
I consign this grievance to Hell...

354
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,216
There was no helping it.

355
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:19,651
You think so?

356
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:22,313
We could've stopped it,
if that hadn't happened.

357
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,393
You know...

358
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:33,330
If you only look up a little,
there's this vast sky overhead.

359
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,763
Yeah...

360
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:54,519
"Mina Minato"

361
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,357
"Mina Minato"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

362
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:00,354
"Mina Minato"

363
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:20,141
Always a dead end

364
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:26,814
There is no escape

365
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:34,922
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

366
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:39,188
And I'll let it fly

367
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,602
This place is ephemeral

368
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:58,579
An eternity that binds me

369
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:05,586
Coming or going

370
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:17,157
All that passes by are dreams

371
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,378
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

372
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,947
Your name?

373
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,115
Yumi.

374
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:37,852
Why? Because you are not loved?

375
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,489
I was bad at being loved.

376
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,658
I know that,

377
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:47,728
but I don't want to be
treated like this anymore!

378
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,430
Your wish?

379
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,533
Banish that person to Hell for me!

380
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,836
Your grievance has been heard.

381
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:56,237
"Hell Girl
A Night Among Traveling Entertainers"

382
00:24:56,237 --> 00:25:00,196
"Hell Girl
A Night Among Traveling Entertainers"
Next time, "A Night Among
Traveling Entertainers".
