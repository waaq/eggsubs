1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,190
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,990
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,590
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,130
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,870
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,270
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,080
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,250
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,620
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,890
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:52,670
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,370
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,110
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,350
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,980
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,960
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,760
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:26,600
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,270
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:37,380
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,050
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,280
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,880
Tsugumi, you sure this is the place?

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,280
Yeah.

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
It was this hospital.

26
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,120
"The Light of the Hospital Ward"

27
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,460
A nurse that's young
and beautiful to boot, huh?

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,920
But she's the sort of person that's
going to get sent to Hell, okay?

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,070
You know,

30
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,400
it's not like I'm trying to prevent
her from being banished to Hell...

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,470
...because she's young
and beautiful.

32
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,970
Hajime, let's not do this!

33
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,740
It's just not good to get in
the way of the kind of person

34
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,970
who's backed into a corner and has
no choice but to go to Hell Girl!

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,050
You're still saying things like that?

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,040
Because...

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,730
I'm not going to condone revenge.
Not ever.

38
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,060
Honestly!

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,760
What's wrong, Tsugumi?

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,950
Hello.

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,940
Oh, hello.

42
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Is it her?

43
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,460
Yeah.

44
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,560
Kanako Sakuragi, 23 years old.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,030
Graduated from Joto Prefectural
Nursing School.

46
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,070
Her address is...

47
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,750
Good grief...

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,620
There's no way there are
any bad rumors about her!

49
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,890
Kanako's good to her parents
and she's a hard worker.

50
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,560
She went to nursing school
instead of college...

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,230
...because of her family's finances.

52
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,900
Um, what about a boyfriend or...

53
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,540
My! You've set your sights
on a nice girl!

54
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,370
What?

55
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,940
Uh, well...

56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,070
But she says it'd get
in the way of her work...

57
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,580
...and she wouldn't have time
for him anyway,

58
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,510
so she says she doesn't want one.

59
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,780
That's too bad.

60
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,440
Seriously. You don't find
nice girls like her these days.

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
There's no way there's
a problem with her parents.

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,260
She's the way she is
because of her parents.

63
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,390
Then, could she have done
something to cause resentment?

64
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,200
No, no! There is
no way she could have!

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,190
This is utterly ridiculous.

66
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,460
Oh, speak of the devil...

67
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,170
Hello.

68
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,880
Ah, going to work now?

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,480
I have the night shift today.

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,610
But more importantly, Grandpa,
are you eating properly?

71
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,790
Quit worrying about everyone else
and worry about yourself!

72
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,620
I'm fine!

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,860
Well, if anything happens,
you come right to the hospital, okay?

74
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,190
Bye.

75
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,990
Well? Nice girl, isn't she?

76
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,310
There's nothing.

77
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,270
No matter who I ask, there's nothing.

78
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,270
Maybe the problem's inside
the hospital, after all.

79
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,150
I know!

80
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,980
Mr. Hajime Shibata...

81
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,590
You're staying at the hospital
for some tests?

82
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,820
Yes.

83
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,120
Do you have any symptoms
that are bothering you?

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,460
The area around the stomach
feels a little heavy...

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,290
That's certainly cause for concern.

86
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,060
But you'll be fine.

87
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,030
It's true what they say
about worry causing illness,

88
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,370
so rather than brooding about it,

89
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,170
please go into this with
a positive outlook, okay?

90
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,210
A-All right.

91
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,080
That's the spirit!

92
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,070
Well, then, if you have any
questions, feel free to ask me.

93
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,880
Kana, my stomach's
not feeling good, either!

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,250
All right, I will give you
a shot later, Mr. Yamada.

95
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,520
What?!

96
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,660
A looker, isn't she?

97
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,230
Wha... sure...

98
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,160
With an awesome personality.
I wish I could be hospitalized for life.

99
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,970
The old man that used
to be in that bed over there...

100
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,630
...said the same thing
before he died yesterday.

101
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,640
But being as cute as she is,

102
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,180
I wonder if she isn't resented
by her coworkers sometimes.

103
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,150
Not likely.

104
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,510
Nope, nope.

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,650
I don't know about that...

106
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,220
We're telling you,
there's just no way!

107
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,320
Miss Sakuragi again?

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,660
Again?

109
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,760
One in two male patients ask
about Miss Sakuragi, you know.

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Like, "Does she have a boyfriend?"

111
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,470
Or, "What kind of guy does she like?"

112
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,870
-It's always about stuff like that.
-It's always about stuff like that.

113
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,400
Are you one of those, too?

114
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,670
Well... oh, man!

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,380
So, then,

116
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,580
is she maybe not very popular
among her coworkers like you girls?

117
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,480
Not at all!

118
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,150
She's good at what
she does and she's nice.

119
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,020
Nice, so nice. She's not
two-faced about it, either.

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,890
It's a tough job, but it's been
a real help having her around.

121
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,560
Really?

122
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,960
Really, really.

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,270
You must really like her!

124
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,290
Well... really, right?

125
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,840
There really is nothing.

126
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,210
Who is it?

127
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,010
Who the heck would want her gone?

128
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,780
You can't tell with people
just by looking at them, right?

129
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,420
There's no knowing what she
might be doing in secret.

130
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,750
She really doesn't have
that kind of vibe.

131
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,890
You're just not a good
judge of character.

132
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,930
What?

133
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,830
My, that looks delicious.

134
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,100
Oh...

135
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Is she yours?

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,170
My unworthy daughter.

137
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,800
My! How could you say such a thing?

138
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,340
Hello.

139
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Tsugumi!

140
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,880
Oh, no, it's all right.
Please don't worry about it.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,520
Oh, Miss Sakuragi, if you'd like,
please have this.

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,450
Oh, please don't mind me.

143
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,090
Not at all. It's the least
I can do to apologize.

144
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,080
Really, the regulations
don't allow me to.

145
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,050
Tsugumi?

146
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,470
It's no surprise that
the reporter's at a complete loss.

147
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,810
Well, for once, I doubt he'll
be able to interfere this time.

148
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,310
But it's the Miss
that you have to feel sorry for.

149
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,610
Yeah...

150
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,140
But that's her fate...

151
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,300
Is it really all right
for it to be this way?

152
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,630
Are you uncertain, Ai?

153
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,600
Darkness...

154
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,830
You know, that was immature of you.

155
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,330
But I'm a kid.

156
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,370
Well, yeah, but...

157
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,340
I want to see the person in charge!

158
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Talking to you guys
is getting me nowhere,

159
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,170
so I'm demanding to see
the person in charge!

160
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,570
"Nurse's Station"
so I'm demanding to see
the person in charge!

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,810
"Nurse's Station"
But as I said, this matter
has already been explained...

162
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,710
"Nurse's Station"
That was nonsense!

163
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,050
That was nonsense!

164
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,520
Mr. Higuchi, there is not a single lie
or falsehood in our explanation.

165
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,420
Just like we have told you many times,

166
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,790
your wife passed away because
there was nothing more we could do for her.

167
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,790
You're lying!

168
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,990
I know!

169
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,800
I talked to numerous lawyers
to try to sue this hospital!

170
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,000
But they barely even listened to me
before every last one turned me down!

171
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,470
Hey!

172
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,410
You guys got to them, didn't you?!

173
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,680
We would never do such a thing!

174
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,840
You listen good!

175
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,010
Because of the mistake you made,
Yoshiko...

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,050
Because of you...

177
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,690
Oh, Mr. Shibata...

178
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,860
Oh, well, I heard some yelling, so...

179
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,160
Oh, Mr. Higuchi.

180
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,260
Higuchi...

181
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,370
He lost his wife,
but he believes it was because...

182
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,770
...of a mistake Miss Sakuragi made
and he refuses to question his belief.

183
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,710
Really, talk about repaying
kindness with resentment.

184
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,370
I'm not forgiving you!

185
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,180
No matter what anyone says,
I'm never forgiving you as long as I live!

186
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,150
I swear, I'll send you to Hell!

187
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,810
That's a promise!

188
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,740
Yoshiko... Yoshiko...

189
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,070
Yoshiko...

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,010
Who are you?

191
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,010
I'm a freelance reporter.

192
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,610
"Shibata"
I'm a freelance reporter.

193
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,550
"Shibata"
Would you mind telling
me about your wife's death?

194
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,430
There's nothing.

195
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,690
No matter who I ask, there's nothing.

196
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,700
...talk about repaying kindness
with resentment.

197
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,170
Tsugumi?

198
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,170
Tsugumi, what's wrong?

199
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,680
What's wrong?

200
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,750
What's wrong, Tsugumi?

201
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,530
Tsugumi... Tsugumi...

202
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:06,300
Tsugumi...

203
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,450
Tsugumi...

204
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,750
Tsugumi?!

205
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
Tsugumi!

206
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,490
What's wrong?!

207
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,820
Tsugumi?! Tsugumi?!

208
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,990
Mr. Higuchi,

209
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,560
I investigated everything
I could regarding Yoshiko's death.

210
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,240
I see, and did you
find any conclusive proof?

211
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,670
Yes, I did.

212
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,380
That your assertion is nonsense.

213
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,110
I see.

214
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,650
Then, leave!

215
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,520
So you turn a deaf ear when the talk turns
to things you don't want to hear.

216
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,850
What?!

217
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,750
No matter how I investigated every angle,

218
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,890
I could find no fault with what
the hospital and Nurse Sakuragi did.

219
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,890
Mr. Higuchi,
this is all just in your head.

220
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,600
I get it, you were asked to come here,
too, weren't you?!

221
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,500
That hospital sure does
some underhanded things!

222
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
How much did you get?!

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,710
Or did you come to blackmail me?!

224
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:09,440
Mr. Higuchi, I do feel bad for you
that your wife passed away.

225
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,810
I lost my wife, too.

226
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,620
I understand well what it feels
to be a widower.

227
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,320
But trying to hurt someone
that has done no wrong...

228
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,090
...in an attempt to cover up
your grief is wrong.

229
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,690
Am I wrong?

230
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,060
Do you have any children?

231
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,530
One daughter.

232
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,370
I have none.

233
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,800
My wife was my entire life.

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,870
I never wanted much,

235
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,970
if we could just peacefully
grow old together,

236
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,770
I thought that was enough.

237
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,480
I doubt you could
understand that, though.

238
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,620
So, then, who am I supposed
to turn this feeling on?!

239
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,080
Mr. Higuchi...

240
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,620
It's that woman...

241
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,790
It's that woman's fault.

242
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,780
That woman...

243
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,230
Mr. Higuchi, was it you?

244
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,220
Were you the one who accessed
the Hell Link site?

245
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,510
The one who asked Hell Girl
to avenge you against Nurse Sakuragi...

246
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,380
Aren't you the one?!

247
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,010
What are you talking about?

248
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,550
Please do not start playing dumb now.

249
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,750
Access? Is that to do with
the so-called internet thing?

250
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,410
Sorry, but I can't make heads
or tails of that stuff.

251
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,420
It can't be...

252
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,160
Are you awake?

253
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,540
You seem to be doing
a lot better now...

254
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,010
If you're still hurting,

255
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,810
I'll have a pediatrician
take a look at you, though.

256
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,210
I'm fine.

257
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,410
I see. I'm glad.

258
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Hey...

259
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,750
Here...

260
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,740
Thank you.

261
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,750
Thank you.

262
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,700
Yesterday...

263
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,340
When you were being yelled
at by that man...

264
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,830
I saw it.

265
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,960
I see.

266
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,880
Were you scared?

267
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,080
A little.

268
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,280
That man is a lonely person.

269
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,290
He suddenly lost his wife,
whom he'd been married to for a long time.

270
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,290
He must be unable to cope
with that pain...

271
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,490
So, he's not really a scary person.

272
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,030
Stuff like that happens
a lot at the hospital.

273
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,200
But if taking his anger out on me...

274
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
...serves to alleviate
his pain even a little,

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,300
I think maybe that's part
of my job, too.

276
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,910
Or something like that.

277
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,410
But you're getting sent to Hell...

278
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,870
What're you doing, Tsugumi?

279
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,390
She got sent...

280
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,690
What?

281
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,430
She got sent to Hell...

282
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,760
Tsugumi...

283
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,360
Tsugumi!

284
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,980
Where am I?

285
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,140
Why am I on a boat?

286
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,150
Who are you?

287
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,290
I am Ai Enma.

288
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,960
I am sending you to Hell.

289
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,520
Hell?!

290
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,890
No way!

291
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,760
Why?

292
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,660
Why am I...

293
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,230
What for?!

294
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,560
Who would do such a thing?!

295
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,650
It's him?!

296
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,990
It was him.

297
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,890
I don't know him.
I don't know him!

298
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,060
I've never even met him!

299
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Who is he?!
Why would he do such a thing?!

300
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,370
No... I don't want this...

301
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,940
Please, help me!

302
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,270
Help me!

303
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,050
Please!

304
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,540
Help me!

305
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,490
This job sure left a bad aftertaste...

306
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,360
But it's something that's happened
lots of times over the centuries.

307
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,330
Grudges come in as many shapes
as people do...

308
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,130
The Miss is to be commended
for carrying out her duty.

309
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,120
But my ears can hear it...

310
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,360
The Miss's heart cracking
under the strain...

311
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,810
I consign this grievance to Hell...

312
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,800
Nooo!

313
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,480
Why?

314
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,810
Why?!

315
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,020
Who knows who the hell this guy is
or what the hell he was thinking...

316
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,990
And to fall victim to a guy like that...

317
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,160
...is wrong.

318
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,150
It's absolutely wrong!

319
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,930
Do you still think that getting revenge
is the righteous thing to do?

320
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,470
Would you still defend Hell Girl?!

321
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,420
I don't know... I don't know...

322
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,890
Tsugumi...

323
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,390
I don't know!

324
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,720
Tsugumi!

325
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,370
Why...

326
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,700
Why?

327
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,170
There!

328
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,190
It's cold!

329
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,030
Y-You're... Hell Girl!

330
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,020
I... I...

331
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,640
I wanted you to...

332
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,010
You know?

333
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,110
What?

334
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,440
You know Sentaro?

335
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,770
What?

336
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,060
Always a dead end

337
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,740
There is no escape

338
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:34,840
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

339
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,110
And I'll let it fly

340
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,520
This place is ephemeral

341
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:58,500
An eternity that binds me

342
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,510
Coming or going

343
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:17,080
All that passes by are dreams

344
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,330
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

345
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,530
The thread that linked
the Miss to the Shibata family...

346
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:40,440
It was an abominable bond
that reached across 400 years.

347
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,580
The scattered cherry blossoms
begin to impart their memories.

348
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,950
History erased.

349
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,050
In the mountains, covered in deep snow,

350
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,550
a deep-seated hatred pushes open
the door to the Miss's heart.

351
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,920
And then, the Miss...

352
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,550
Next time, "Home in the Twilight"

353
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,250
"Hell Girl
Home in the Twilight"
Next time, "Home in the Twilight"

354
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,750
"Hell Girl
Home in the Twilight"
