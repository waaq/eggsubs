00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:03,192
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,861
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,996
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

4
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:09,599
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,137
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,873
Beyond the veil of midnight,

7
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:20,272
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,081
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:34,219

16
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,987
In this craziness, uncertainty

17
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:15,995
Hitori hitori no omoi o bokura wa

18
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,764
In this craziness, you gave me life

00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:26,605
Hitotsu no omoi o bokura wa

In this craziness, uncertainty

00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:37,416
Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa

22
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,052
In this craziness, you gave me life

Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa

24
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,472
This is incredible!

25
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:07,609
The heavy train is slowly
floating up into the night sky!

26
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,645
Esper Watanabe is lifting the train
with the power of his hands,

27
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,880
just as he said he would!

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,848
It floats! It floats!

29
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,338
What a farce!

30
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,720
Who said that?!

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,489
Unbelievable! The subject
of a lot of recent talk!

32
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,820
Who?!

33
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,394
The good-looking psychic medium!

34
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:30,832
His name is Gilles de L'Enfer!
And he has burst onto the show!

35
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,891
I've come to expose your lie!

36
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,274
Gilles!

37
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,910
Wh-What's going on?

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,377
I wasn't told about this!

39
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:45,880
"Please crush him!"

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,049
Y-You can't mean that!

41
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,984
That's Esper Watanabe for you!

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,453
He courageously takes
on Gilles's challenge!

43
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:53,886
What?!

44
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,400
Wh-What the heck is this?!

45
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,410
Stop!

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,478
Stop this! Come on!

47
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:20,448
If you want me to stop,
acknowledge your lie.

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,717
Cut it out!

49
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:25,119
If you won't acknowledge it,
you'll go to Hell!

50
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,019
Please stop this!

51
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:34,283
"Hell Girl vs. Hell Boy"

52
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:41,524
What are we going to do if
the Miss finds out about this?

53
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,126
It'll be fine if she doesn't, right?

54
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,855
That's true, but...

55
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:52,335
If she finds out, you tell her
we repeatedly tried to stop you.

56
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,996
All right, all right.

57
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,603
This is the place.

58
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:00,276
What's that?

59
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,043
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
What's that?

60
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,411
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
Quit it!

61
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,814
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
Mr. Esper Watanabe, what's wrong?!

62
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,314
Mr. Esper Watanabe, what's wrong?!

63
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:08,184
He is currently in a different world.

64
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,486
It's over the top,
even for a staged show.

65
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:11,888
You don't believe it?

66
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,289
Of course, not.

67
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,757
Oh, really.

68
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,193
Even though you believe in Hell Girl?

69
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,528
-It's a lie! It's a complete lie...

70
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,296
-It's coming from the TV.
-It's a lie! It's a complete lie...

71
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,899
-But still...
...that I have psychic powers!

72
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,600
-I don't think sending people to Hell...
...that I have psychic powers!

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,370
...is the only solution there is.
-It's true! It's true that it's a lie!

74
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,703
...is the only solution there is.
-I have no psychic powers whatsoever!

75
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:31,274
-So you have to stop doing
this kind of thing.
-I have no psychic powers whatsoever!

76
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,542
-It's true! Please believe me!

77
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,110
-What was that all of a sudden?
-It's true! Please believe me!

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,343
-What was that all of a sudden?
-I really don't have any powers!

79
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:35,211
-Who knows?
-I really don't have any powers!

80
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,746
-Looks like something's up.
-It's all a lie!

81
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:37,914
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
-It's all a lie!

82
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,448
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
Forgive me! Forgive me!
I have no psychic powers!

83
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,852
Forgive me! Forgive me!
I have no psychic powers!

84
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,987
-It was all tricks! Forgive me!

85
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:48,057
-Well? Do you sense any
response from her?
-It was all tricks! Forgive me!

86
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:51,194
-Nope. Can we really
communicate with her?
-It's true! It's a lie!

87
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:51,661
-Nope. Can we really
communicate with her?
-Please believe me!

88
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,695
-I see.
-Please believe me!

89
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:53,596
-I see.
-It's hot!

90
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:57,200
-Since you can see things
that Hell Girl sees,
-It's hot!

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,571
I was thinking she'd be able
to see things that you see, but...

92
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,507
What do they mean by communicate?

93
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:07,476
So that's what's been going on.

94
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:09,779
-Do you think she's seeing
the TV show we're watching, too?
-Stop it! Please stop it!

95
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,614
-I don't know.
-Stop it! Please stop it!

96
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:13,482
That's enough. Let's get out of here.

97
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,951
I agree.

98
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:15,284
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"

99
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:17,653
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
Just what did you do to Esper Watanabe?

100
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,986
"Psychic Medium Gilles de L'Enfer
Challenges Esper Watanabe!!"
I showed him a glimpse...of Hell.

101
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,794
What a load of crap.

102
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:27,524
No kidding. Damn bogus psychic medium.

103
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:34,103
Ms. Abe, what are we going to do with
the show starting next week?

104
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,905
Isn't it obvious?

105
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,066
We'll have that kid
take over as the star.

106
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,645
Well, I look forward to working
with you starting next week.

107
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:43,946
Likewise.

108
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,681
Oh, good work!

109
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,149
Shuddup!

110
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,418
I bet he resents you for this.

111
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,321
Since we've already started,
let's have him resent me more.

112
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,623
What?

113
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:55,725
Do you know about Hell Girl?

114
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,526
I've heard about it.

115
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:01,430
She smells like the real thing,
the same as me.

116
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,734
It could be that she
is not of this world.

117
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:07,637
I-I see, but then...

118
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:13,276
Yes. Gilles de L'Enfer
versus Hell Girl...

119
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,811
Wouldn't you like
to see that, Ms. Abe?

120
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:18,114
I do! I'd definitely
want to see that!

121
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:21,851
But where should I go
to get that appointment?

122
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:24,587
If it's an appointment,
let's ask Mr. Watanabe to get it.

123
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,657
Oh, that's true!
That's a great idea!

124
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,989
I'll go discuss this with
the organizer right away!

125
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,398
Hell Girl, don't get cocky,

126
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,500
just because you're
the talk of the net.

127
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,767
No idea.

128
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:51,013
Then, you were communicating
to her without knowing it?

129
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,982
Oh!

130
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:56,686
Which means, things get communicated
from you to her,

131
00:06:56,686 --> 00:07:00,022
but stuff doesn't get communicated
from her to you, huh?

132
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:03,048
Thank goodness! That guy earlier...

133
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:16,633
Anyway, we can trust
you on that, right?

134
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,974
It made a sound!

135
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,348
I'm ruined!

136
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:28,851
I should never have accepted
a challenge like that!

137
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,877
So why am I polishing my boots?!

138
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,817
I'm done for!

139
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:43,559
Aw, man, I would've liked to be
a little more popular before I died.

140
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,403
Yes?

141
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:51,307
Oh, Mr. Watanabe?
Good work today! It's Abe.

142
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:52,475
What?!

143
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,410
Thank you for always calling on me!

144
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,947
This is Esper Watanabe! Come to me
for all your psychic power needs!

145
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:02,451
Thanks to you, the response
to today's broadcast was enormous!

146
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,687
We're talking about
doing a continuation.

147
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,589
So how about it?
Want a revenge match?

148
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,356
Against Gilles!

149
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,691
What?!

150
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,327
I'll do it! I'll do it!
I'll definitely do it!

151
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:13,028
No, please let me do it!

152
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:14,630
Okay, glad to hear it.

153
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,166
Then I'll see you
at the studio at 9pm tomorrow.

154
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,293
You can count on me!

155
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,572
This is my chance!

156
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,474
Just you watch, Gilles!

157
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:29,612
This time, I'll stab you in the back!
No, I'll skewer you in the back!

158
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:30,943
Goodbye!

159
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,584
This kind of set should be good, right?

160
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:38,988
Yes. Incidentally,
when is this being aired?

161
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:42,258
With it being so late,
we can't do a live broadcast,

162
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:45,094
but we've booked the special
programming slot for tomorrow.

163
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:46,796
And what about him?

164
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,431
He's coming in at 9pm.

165
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:52,299
He was awfully fired up that
he'd get revenge for yesterday.

166
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,871
When he finds out that was a lie,

167
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,507
his hatred will grow even more.

168
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,242
Only when we've pushed him
to that point

169
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:03,446
will he even have a chance
at contacting Hell Girl.

170
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:07,616
Right. I've told the staff members
to pull out all the stops.

171
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,385
Thank you for that.

172
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,353
By the way, I wonder
how long it takes...

173
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:14,156
...for Hell Girl to come after
you've contacted her.

174
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,157
Who knows?

175
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:18,752
Does she take the train?
Or maybe she'll come by car?

176
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,499
Good evening.

177
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,796
Who might you be?

178
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:28,170
So, what do you want?

179
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,073
Yes, well, there are some things
I'd like to ask you about.

180
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,074
If it's an interview,

181
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,877
could you please go through
our station's PR department?

182
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,141
Is it true that you've been to Hell?

183
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,882
It's true.

184
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:42,117
When was that?

185
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:43,319
When I was a child.

186
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,288
As I said, please go through
the PR department for an interview!

187
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:49,621
Then, do you know of Hell Girl?

188
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,832
What are you talking about?
We aren't doing anything...

189
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:59,301
There's a message I'd like
to pass along to Hell Girl.

190
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,704
I told you, we don't know anything!

191
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:02,638
What message?

192
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,206
What?!

193
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:05,975
"Stop this now."

194
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,943
"It will make no one happy."

195
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:11,106
"Revenge is meaningless,"
is my message.

196
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:16,018
Revenge is meaningless, you say?

197
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,349
Yes.

198
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:21,457
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,425
Do you suppose it's hypocritical?

200
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:26,195
No, I'm sure it's as you say.

201
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,964
But though you might
know that intellectually,

202
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,731
deep in your heart, you cannot
resist the urge to crush your opponent.

203
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,162
That is the way with people.

204
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:45,014
That may be true, but...

205
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,416
Then what about you?

206
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,484
What?

207
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:49,974
Well?

208
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:01,193
"Shibata Family Grave"

209
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,073
What did you do?!

210
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,576
That was your wife, wasn't it?

211
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:16,812
For what it's worth,
I'll convey your message.

212
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,714
Though, of course,

213
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:22,184
I doubt there will be a response.

214
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,516
Is he the real thing?

215
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:35,864
It's almost midnight! How long
are you going to make me wait?!

216
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:39,034
Well, I think it might take a while.

217
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,770
The filming for Gilles is taking
longer than expected.

218
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,639
Why is it just Gilles?!

219
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,241
There's no revenge if I'm not there!

220
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:46,508
-Well, that's true, but...

221
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:49,979
-It's going just as planned.
-Well, that's true, but...

222
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,914
Oh, okay.

223
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:54,316
You're the only one thinking
you'll get revenge...

224
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:57,620
...and Gilles wants to fight someone
more powerful is what he's saying.

225
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,654
What?!

226
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,689
Just what is the meaning of this?!

227
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,157
-Now should be a good time...
-Well, so like,

228
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:02,591
-Now should be a good time...
-that's just what Gilles is saying.

229
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,561
-Yes, shall we get him a snack?
-That's just what Gilles is saying.

230
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:08,397
Mr. Watanabe, you must be hungry.

231
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,399
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Here you are!

232
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,369
-Stop it! Stop it!
-A little snack from Gilles for you!

233
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,405
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

234
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,872
You're going to give me burns!

235
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:23,278
Damn that Gilles de L'Enfer!

236
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,281
Just how much does he have to mock
me before he's satisfied?!

237
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:29,614
I'll sue him later for sure!

238
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,009
A computer?

239
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,899
Hell Link?

240
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,668
It's hard to say if
it's the Miss's fault...

241
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,670
...or if it's the fault
of that guy's daughter...

242
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,194
Keep your voice down.

243
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,041
Anyway, I don't think...

244
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,411
...the possibilities are
necessarily limited to either or.

245
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:57,646
What do you mean?

246
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:01,241
Maybe there's some kind of
connection between the two of them.

247
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,582
We have a request.
Come with me.

248
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:23,939
Wh-Who are you?

249
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,474
You summoned me, remember?

250
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:27,066
I am Ai Enma.

251
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:29,912
Ai...

252
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,847
You're really pretty.

253
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:32,915
Take it.

254
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,116
What?

255
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,118
Okay...

256
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:38,420
What am I supposed to do with this?

257
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,924
If you really want retribution,

258
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,393
untie that red thread.

259
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:48,731
By untying the thread, you will enter
into a covenant with me.

260
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,833
This will, huh?

261
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,636
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

262
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,738
Then let me get right to it!

263
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:58,006
However, once you have
your retribution,

264
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,909
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

265
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:01,777
What?

266
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,246
Curses come home to roost.

267
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:08,450
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

268
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,785
What?!

269
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,685
That's only after you die, though.

270
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,658
Are you scared?

271
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,827
Y-Yeah...

272
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,385
Of course, he's scared!

273
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,035
What the-?! What the-?!

274
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,470
Gag!

275
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,462
What the heck is this?!
I wasn't told about this!

276
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:40,516
Welcome! I am happy to make your
acquaintance, Ai Enma!

277
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,351
Whoa! You!

278
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,852
And you are?

279
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:46,488
I am Gilles de L'Enfer!

280
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,291
It means "Gilles of Hell!"

281
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:53,028
I am honored that the real Hell Girl
has come to join me here.

282
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,831
Gilles, how dare you use me like this?!

283
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:57,321
Good work.

284
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:03,205
Hot! Hot, hot! Hot, hot!

285
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,742
Daikon radish is a great garnish
for a ham like you!

286
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:10,245
Now, allow me to explain
the plan for today.

287
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:13,916
Right now, I am the most
talked about person on TV...

288
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,219
...and you are the most talked
about person on the net,

289
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,822
and the idea is to have a
life-and-death Hell showdown...

290
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:22,484
...and bring it to people's living rooms!
That's the show!

291
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,365
So we fell right into their trap.

292
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,568
There's no way you'll
win against the Miss.

293
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,036
How promising.

294
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,938
I wouldn't have it any other way.

295
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,739
Hold on a second, Gilles!

296
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,575
Just who are you talking to?!

297
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,944
We can't have a show like this!

298
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:45,614
What are you talking about?!
They're right here!

299
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,683
Huh? What?

300
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,384
Gag!

301
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:51,249
What the-?!

302
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,348
Hey, what's going on over there?!

303
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,293
What is this?

304
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:02,252
How am I going to explain a show that
makes no sense to the higher-ups?

305
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:08,437
You're a great help.

306
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:10,371
Now, you two go as well!

307
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:15,606
Damn it!

308
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:18,614
It's no use.

309
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:20,809
You guys won't be able to get loose.

310
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:29,087
Finally, it's just the two of us.

311
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,831
Oh, yes, I have a message for you
from a reporter named Shibata.

312
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:38,265
He says revenge isn't good.

313
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:43,171
He was giving himself
an awfully righteous air.

314
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,706
Considering how
pretentious he was,

315
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:46,608
he should be writing
about Hell instead,

316
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:50,312
where those who have committed evil
deeds reside after being condemned.

317
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:52,581
But well, I suppose it would
be impossible for him.

318
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:57,920
Unlike me, he wouldn't be able
to come back from Hell.

319
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,157
That's right.
I was born with psychic powers.

320
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:06,261
When my parents realized that,
they killed me out of fear.

321
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:09,097
But I came back from Hell.

322
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,291
And then...

323
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,635
The first thing I did
after I came back...

324
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,627
...was to send my own
parents to Hell.

325
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,309
Wh-What's this?!

326
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,278
Being young, I had more power
than I could manage...

327
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:27,649
...and I was causing chaos around me,
so maybe there was no helping it.

328
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,618
If I had been a little older,

329
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:34,389
perhaps I could have understood
what my parents did.

330
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,391
But I still would have done it.

331
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:40,395
The perfect murder with absolutely
no evidence left behind.

332
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:42,989
The massacre of my entire family.

333
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,806
I don't intend to justify my revenge.

334
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:56,111
But even so, my powers have brought
me nothing but suffering.

335
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:58,579
You can understand me, can't you?

336
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,249
A-Ai...

337
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:03,885
The only time I send others to Hell...

338
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:07,255
...is when I can't control my own
feelings because of my hatred.

339
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,246
You understand that, don't you?

340
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:15,464
You understand that, don't you?

341
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,625
You do, don't you?

342
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,293
Say something.

343
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:23,538
Say it!

344
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,062
Watch out, Ai!

345
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:28,410
Miss!

346
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,810
Can't you do something, Wanyuudou?!

347
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,883
This fight would be ours,
if only the thread were untied.

348
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,719
You apparently send villains to Hell
for the sake of others,

349
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,488
but ultimately, that's hypocrisy!

350
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,390
You have all of that power,

351
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,018
so why don't you try
to use it for yourself?!

352
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:49,965
Your clothes are in tatters.

353
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:53,435
I couldn't bring myself
to send you to Hell like this.

354
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:57,098
I'll change you into
a new set of clothes.

355
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,745
It looks good on you.

356
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,612
It looks very good on you.

357
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,886
Now, it's time to say goodbye.

358
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,217
So long!

359
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,789
Ai!

360
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,056
You all can hold a memorial
in her honor!

361
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,036
Ai...

362
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,150
Ai?!

363
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,218
What?!

364
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:44,619
You're all right?

365
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,222
Why did you let him
do whatever he wanted?

366
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,053
I was thinking.

367
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,595
This can't be possible!

368
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:56,798
Now, Miss, get back at him
for all you're worth!

369
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,600
The thread hasn't been untied.

370
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,237
But at this rate,
you must feel frustrated, too!

371
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,398
What I feel doesn't matter.

372
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:07,998
Let's go home.

373
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:12,514
You mean to go home after
the beating you got?!

374
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,217
Then I'll untie it!

375
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,515
I-I-I'll untie it!

376
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,160
If you untie it,
you'll be going to Hell, too.

377
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,864
If I don't untie the thread now,
you'll do me in someday!

378
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:32,467
There's no way you'll forgive
me for asking for revenge!

379
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,536
I'll forgive you. Really.

380
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:35,971
You're lying!

381
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,673
Hell is far more terrifying
than you can imagine.

382
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,308
You could never endure it.

383
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:42,010
Don't mock me!

384
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,741
Behold the pride of a hammy actor!

385
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:51,183
Your grievance has been heard.

386
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:07,169
Stop!

387
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,904
Stop this!

388
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:12,274
Father...Mother...

389
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,875
Teacher...

390
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,711
Make them stop their revenge!

391
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,648
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

392
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,083
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

393
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,953
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

394
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,923
Care to give death a try?

395
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,914
You mean "again," right?

396
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,443
Hell again, huh?

397
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:51,580
I'll concede victory to you this time.

398
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,482
But no matter how many times
I'm sent to Hell,

399
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:58,316
I will come back to life
and settle this match!

400
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:05,516
I consign this grievance to Hell...

401
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,637
Oh, man...

402
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:18,697
Looks like I managed to survive somehow.

403
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:34,548
Ai, you have a request.

404
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,414
All right.

405
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,143
"Hiroshi Watanabe"

406
00:22:55,143 --> 00:23:00,345
"Hiroshi Watanabe"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

407
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:20,064
Itsudatte yukidomari de

408
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:26,738

Sugite yuku wa yume

415
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,398
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

416
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,101
Your name?

417
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,902
Yuko Murai.

418
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:37,271
You hate him?

419
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:40,541
My father trusted him.

420
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,511
He really relied on him
for emotional support...

421
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:46,447
And yet, from the start, that man...

422
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,316
Your wish?

423
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:50,918
Banish him to Hell for me!

424
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:54,689
Your grievance has been heard.

425
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:55,953
Next time, "Kind Neighbor."

426
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,322
"Hell Girl
Kind Neighbor"
Next time, "Kind Neighbor."

427
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,822
"Hell Girl
Kind Neighbor"
