00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,895
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,633
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,171
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,907
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:29,085
Itsuka hikari ni mukau sakasama no chou

Hitori hitori no katachi o bokura wa

Sorezore no katachi o bokura wa

23
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,736
So? Have you made any friends?

24
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,465
Yup! I've made lots!

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,011
Mother, I'll help you
make the pot stickers.

26
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,913
Oh? Can you do it?

27
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,006
Sure, I can!

28
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,439
"Okame Express"

29
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:40,784
Mother!

30
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,308
Oh, right.

31
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:54,027
"Early Afternoon Window"

32
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:15,315
Mother, what's wrong?
You're all spaced out.

33
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:16,516
Oh, it's nothing.

34
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:18,984
Come on, we better hurry
or your father will be home.

35
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,820
Coming!

36
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:29,684
"Okame Express"

37
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,728
These are from Mrs. Todaka.

38
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,995
She said not to talk.

39
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,908
That if you talk,
it'll be terrible for you.

40
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:05,761
You really love cherries, don't you, Ai?

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,105
Why did you throw them away?

42
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,113
Hey, Mother?

43
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,479
Never you mind!
Just finish what you're doing!

44
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,601
Oh, Mrs. Yasuda, morning.

45
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,874
Good morning.

46
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:50,843
Did you enjoy those cherries?

47
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:53,579
Yes, thank you.

48
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,347
So?

49
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,439
What?

50
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,287
Goodness! I'm only asking how they were!

51
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:05,858
They were quite delicious, thank you.

52
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:09,794
Really. I imagine it was the
perfect refresher for pot stickers.

53
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:14,067
How did you know that?

54
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,403
Your residence smelled
a little last night, so...

55
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:21,374
You have to be careful when
you use garlic, Mrs. Yasuda.

56
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,710
This is a far cry from your provincial
standalone homes on spacious lots.

57
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,214
In a sense, we are in a
communal living arrangement here.

58
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:32,118
Now, now, you two,
why don't you leave it at that?

59
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:35,576
Mrs. Yasuda is just
out of the country, after all.

60
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:42,195
Mrs. Yasuda, I believe...

61
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:46,632
...your daughter transferred into
the same class as my girl, right?

62
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,111
See you later, Mom!

63
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,979
Be careful on your way now!

64
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,071
I will!

65
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,018
I hope we can become good friends as well.

66
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:21,567
Mrs. Yasuda, you should be careful.

67
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,203
It's all over if you incur
Mrs. Todaka's displeasure now.

68
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:26,639
Neither you nor your husband
will find it livable here.

69
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,269
After all, she's the lady behind
the autocratic branch manager.

70
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,726
Doesn't something stink here?

71
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,353
Totally!

72
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,432
It stinks of pot stickers!

73
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:02,542
Pot stickers? Isn't that kind of bad?

74
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,407
That's super bad!

75
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:31,061
I wonder if I did something
to Yuria Todaka...

76
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,679
Why?

77
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,807
She made fun of me,
saying I stank of pot stickers.

78
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,996
Hey, open the door!

79
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,964
Oh, it's Father.

80
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,501
Damn it!

81
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,172
What are you so worked up about?

82
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,506
Hell if I know!

83
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,076
I received a summons from the
branch manager out of the blue

84
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,245
and the next thing I knew, he was
making outrageous accusations.

85
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:16,148
What did I ever do?!

86
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:20,386
You'd better not have done
something to incur his wife's wrath.

87
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:23,589
What's that supposed to mean?
She's the one in the wrong anyway.

88
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,459
Whoa, whoa, you mean you
really did do something?!

89
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,294
Give me a break, okay?

90
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,429
Hold on! I didn't do anything!

91
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,964
I only saw her having an af...

92
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:34,700
Please don't stir up any trouble!

93
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,534
Of all the people, I need to
get along with that branch manager!

94
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:47,546
What? Introduce a friend to me?

95
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:50,716
Yes, he's an incredibly marvelous boy.

96
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:53,586
Marvelous?

97
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,254
You understand, don't you?

98
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,790
-You should enjoy yourself, too.
-What?

99
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,760
At any rate, I'm going to
send him over straight away.

100
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,829
I'll make you sorry if you
pretend not to be home.

101
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:04,921
Bye.

102
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:32,491
Ma'am?! You're home, right?!

103
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,862
Open the door, Ma'am!

104
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:41,267
I came all this way
because you asked me to!

105
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,903
Yo! Let me in!

106
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,938
Come on!

107
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:48,441
-Please stop! The neighbors will hear you!
-Hey, hurry up and open the door!

108
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,209
Hey, do you hear me?!

109
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,812
-No... Go away...
-Hey! Open up!

110
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:55,212
Go away, please...

111
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,725
Say, I don't think you should be
taking your time getting home.

112
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:09,028
It looks like there's
trouble at your place.

113
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:12,565
Some young guy apparently
barged in and caused some trouble.

114
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,233
What?

115
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:17,470
I hear your mother's been
having one affair after another.

116
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,640
It's gotta suck. Having a parent
that's having an affair.

117
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,972
Stop that, you two.

118
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,477
Ow!

119
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,918
I feel so sorry for the daughter.

120
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:41,991
Mother?!

121
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,713
Mother, hang on!

122
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,783
Why?! Why did it come to this?!

123
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,551
It's all over.

124
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:09,422
Once she has it in for you here, it's over.

125
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,490
Why me?

126
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,427
It's Mrs. Todaka who's in the wrong...

127
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,561
Mrs. Todaka?!

128
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,791
What in the world happened?!

129
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:50,196
"Your grievance shall be avenged.
Send"

130
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:54,064
"Your grievance shall be avenged."

131
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:05,077
Happy birthday, Yuria.

132
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:07,446
Wow! Thank you, Dad!

133
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,148
My, isn't that nice?

134
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,084
What about for me?

135
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:16,422
Your birthday is still a ways off.
Don't age on me so fast.

136
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:18,583
My, how rude!

137
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:28,734
Them...

138
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,463
Because of them...

139
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,052
Don't be scared.

140
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,421
You summoned me, after all.

141
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,658
Then, you're...

142
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:56,061
Ai Enma.

143
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,756
Hell Girl...

144
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,971
I want to know what happened
between Mrs. Todaka and my mother.

145
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,240
What will you do once you know?

146
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,544
Once I know, I'll get back at them.

147
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:13,637
Or else, my mother...

148
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:19,084
I don't want to see my mother suffering.

149
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:23,556
I cannot save your mother.

150
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:27,426
All I can do is simply avenge her.

151
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,529
Avenge... her...

152
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,898
Yes.

153
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,433
Take it.

154
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,695
What?

155
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:42,975
If you really want retribution,

156
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:45,644
untie that red thread.

157
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:49,748
You will enter into a covenant with me.

158
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:54,787
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

159
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:56,422
However,

160
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:58,257
once you have your retribution,

161
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:01,627
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

162
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:02,928
Price?

163
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,564
Curses come home to roost.

164
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:10,502
When you die, your soul will go to Hell.

165
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:13,405
You will never see Heaven,

166
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:20,106
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

167
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,873
Do you still want retribution?

168
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,814
Yes.

169
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,895
All right. I'll show you.

170
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,749
This is...

171
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:59,818
Yes, the place where it all began.

172
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,987
And...

173
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,623
Look, here you come.

174
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,558
Us?!

175
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:07,993
This is that day...

176
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:10,018
Sure, I can!

177
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:44,858
I got some great shots.

178
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:52,004
If you don't want these
to be spread around,

179
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,907
you'd better not go telling
unnecessary stories.

180
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:58,377
If you ever do talk... Let's see...

181
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:01,747
How about we have your daughter
play a starring role next time?

182
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,283
What? For real?!

183
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:06,151
Stop it...

184
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,346
Please just stop it!

185
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:18,230
It seems your mother was unlucky
and saw something she needn't see.

186
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,567
Don't just say she was unlucky,
like it's that simple!

187
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,136
It's Yuria's mom who's in the wrong!

188
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:28,273
So why does my mother have
to be the one being tormented?!

189
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:30,609
I can't accept that!

190
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:31,810
Yes...

191
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,779
But that is what I am here for.

192
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:48,293
Mother's home!

193
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:52,397
What have you done?!
You've destroyed my position!

194
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:55,300
And the rumor's going
around the company, too!

195
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,437
That you're entertaining young men!

196
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,239
That's not true! That's all Mrs. Todaka...

197
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,508
Shut up! Don't say any more than that!

198
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:04,643
Why won't you believe me?

199
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:07,679
No, you won't even listen
to what I have to say!

200
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,883
Always, always... All you
care about is your work!

201
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,510
How dare you!

202
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:18,982
I swear! Who do you think
you owe this lifestyle to?!

203
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:29,590
My family is in a shambles.

204
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,897
It's her...

205
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes...

206
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:46,016
It's because of that woman...

207
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,212
Your grievance has been heard.

208
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,082
Yes? Who is it?

209
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:23,288
Delivery for you, Ma'am.

210
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,653
Oh, my.

211
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,065
D-Dear...

212
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:09,668
What is the meaning of this?!

213
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,970
Y-You're wrong! This isn't what you think!

214
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,373
Th-This man forced his way in
and I had no choice...

215
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:16,000
Don't lie to me!

216
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:22,447
You invited that man in, didn't you?!

217
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,950
Please believe me! I'm the victim here!

218
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,077
Why you!

219
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,481
Th-This man really tried to force me!

220
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,852
Namiko!

221
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,374
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

222
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:50,602
You're shameless!

223
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:01,053
Wh-What are you all doing here?!

224
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:04,456
Mother, why did you do this?

225
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,758
It's not true! It's not like that!

226
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,094
I'm going to be bullied at school now!

227
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:11,930
You're wrong!

228
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,900
So it was Mrs. Todaka
who was having the affairs.

229
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,902
You're like a bitch in heat!

230
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:20,472
What a laughingstock she'll be now.

231
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:22,140
It's not true!

232
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,870
Look, she's got a great body for her age.

233
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,556
What in the world is this?

234
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:39,558
What the hell is the deal with you people?!

235
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,651
All of you, just go away!

236
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,637
Who the hell are you, brat?!

237
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:55,774
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

238
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:59,177
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

239
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:02,614
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

240
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:04,844
Care to give death a try?

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,772
Welcome to the end that the
vortex of your lust has brought you to.

242
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:30,230
As unfortunate as it is,
this place is well suited to you.

243
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:38,705
I consign this grievance to Hell...

244
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:54,633
Whether what I did that day
was truly the right thing or not,

245
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:58,203
I do not know.

246
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:00,305
G-Good morning.

247
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,740
Oh, morning.

248
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,109
The whole thing with your mother
must have been difficult.

249
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,545
To think she would run away
with another man!

250
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:09,014
It's no way for the wife
of the branch manager to behave.

251
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:12,108
None of that now.
The child is not to blame.

252
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:19,357
Mother has begun to smile again.

253
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:22,427
That alone is enough for me.

254
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:25,730
I think I am probably happy right now.

255
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,902
It just might be that I'll be
happy for the rest of my life.

256
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,371
But someday, I know...

257
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,829
Yes, when my life comes to an end...

258
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,643
...I will face the consequences
of what I did then, on that day.

259
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,378
Every time I see this seal on my chest...

260
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:50,614
...I am reminded of that.

She doesn't love me.

Not only that, but my future...

278
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:46,467
She's trying to crush
my prospects as an actress!
