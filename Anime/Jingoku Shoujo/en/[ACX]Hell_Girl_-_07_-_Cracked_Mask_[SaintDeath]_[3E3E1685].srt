1
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:04,928
It is said that life's encounters
are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:07,063
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:09,666
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:14,204
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,940
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:29,085
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,257
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,629
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,901
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:52,676
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:55,378
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,114
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:05,355
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,991
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:15,966
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,768
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:26,610
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,279
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:37,387
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,056
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:48,293
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:59,075
For a while there,
I thought she was finished,

24
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,946
but I'm really glad
Ms. Kurenai made a recovery.

25
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,882
She must've found new enthusiasm,
now that she has a successor.

26
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,351
Yes, I imagine so.

27
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:11,421
Ms. Kurenai, my apologies
for not keeping in touch.

28
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,090
Hello. And who is this?

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,559
I am pleased to meet you, Ms. Kurenai.

30
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,194
Haven't I seen you on TV?

31
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,263
Yes, she's one of the
talented girls we represent.

32
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:22,165
My name is Kaworuko Kurushima.

33
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:24,434
I am Kurenai. Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,103
I'm a huge fan of yours!

35
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:30,373
I heard we'll get to see your play,
"Lady Detective", again,

36
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,442
and I'm already looking forward to it!

37
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,543
Thank you.

38
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,879
I wish you all the best. Please excuse us.

39
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,947
Well, Ms. Kurenai, I will see you around.

40
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,116
She's so wonderful!
As youthful as ever and...

41
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,584
What an adorable girl.

42
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,019
More importantly, Ayaka,

43
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,655
with someone
"already looking forward to it",

44
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,824
we cannot afford to
put on a shabby performance.

45
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,189
O-Of course.

46
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,886
"Kurenai Theater Studio"

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,668
What are you doing?!

48
00:02:58,668 --> 00:02:59,769
This will not do!

49
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,339
You are a weeping willow on the street!

50
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:05,775
So why are you swaying
when there isn't even a breeze?!

51
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,378
I-I know, I'm sorry!

52
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,447
Now, one more time, from the top!

53
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:11,539
Yes, Ma'am!

54
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,318
I am a willow...

55
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,082
A serene willow by the river.

56
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,592
Honestly! How many times
do I have to tell you?!

57
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,494
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

58
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:27,097
Maybe she adopted her, not to make her
the future face of the studio,

59
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,833
but so she could abuse her.

60
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,801
No, that's not possible.

61
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:35,138
But it might be hard to
fault people for saying so.

62
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:37,470
I feel bad for Ayaka.

63
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,051
Please...

64
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,313
Please!

00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:58,027

Send"

00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,357
"Send"

69
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,412
Who are you?!

70
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,815
You summoned me, remember?

71
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:29,875
I am Ai Enma.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,224
Hell... Girl...

73
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:38,055
Take it.

74
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:44,366
If you really want retribution,

75
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,036
untie that red thread.

76
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:53,308
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

77
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:57,642
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

78
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,182
However...

79
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:03,084
What?

80
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,053
...once you have your retribution,

81
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:09,024
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

82
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,759
Price?

83
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,995
Curses come home to roost.

84
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:18,967
When you die, your soul will go to Hell.

85
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,457
Hell?!

86
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,279
Change your mind, after all?

87
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,014
Wait!

88
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:37,451
Let me think about this a little. Please.

89
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,440
She adopted me

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,710
because she supposedly
recognized my acting skills then.

91
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,012
So what's with the way
she's treating me now?!

92
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,580
I can't take it anymore!

93
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,981
Go to Hell!

94
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,983
Yo, if it isn't Ayaka.

95
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,118
Takeshi.

96
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,787
Playing with dolls at your age?

97
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,890
Whoa, that's a freakish one you got there!

98
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,692
You gonna curse someone
to death with that?

99
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:21,129
Shut up! Leave me alone!

100
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,497
Let's see it.

101
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,099
Quit it! Give it back!

102
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,434
Wow, this is well-made.

103
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,103
Cut it out!

104
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:30,238
My bad.

105
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,440
That was close.

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,410
By the way, Ayaka,
could we borrow some money?

107
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,578
About 100,000.

108
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,313
What do you need a fortune like that for?

109
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,381
Don't be such babies!

110
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:42,417
You're the daughter of
a well-to-do family now.

111
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,220
It should be a cinch for you, right?

112
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,088
You damn leeches.

113
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,356
I know!

114
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:52,460
Forget about Hell Link. It might be
better to ask these idiots instead.

115
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,963
I'll consider lending it to you,
but on one condition.

116
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:57,999
Woohoo! That's our Ayaka!
Always willing to negotiate!

117
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,694
We'll do whatever you want!

118
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,715
Good evening!

119
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,183
Evening!

120
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:17,519
Who are you people?!

121
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,321
Hey, old lady, give us some money.

122
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,023
We're starving.

123
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:26,394
Get out immediately, or I will scream!

124
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:30,057
You just try it. I'll smash
your face in before you do.

125
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,170
Bitch! How dare you!

126
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,872
Be good now.

127
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:41,042
Hurry up and fork over the money!

128
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:41,876
Ayaka!

129
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,812
Why you!

130
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:47,515
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you
think you're doing?!

131
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:51,486
Shut up! Get out or I'm calling the police!

132
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:55,388
Damn you! Just you watch!
You'll pay for this!

133
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,363
What a woman.

134
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:06,434
Young men these days are so spineless.

135
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,603
Are you hurt at all, Mother?

136
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,572
No, I'm fine.

137
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,174
Thank goodness. Just to be safe,
I'll call the police...

138
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:18,179
Ayaka, were those men by any chance
old acquaintances of yours?

139
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,682
I'm sorry, Mother.

140
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:23,852
The truth is, they've been
following me around these last few days,

141
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,487
threatening to leak stories
from my time at the orphanage

142
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,990
to the media, whether the
stories are true or not.

143
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,426
But with what just happened,

144
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:35,296
I will properly report it to the police
tomorrow and have them caught.

145
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,165
Can I trust you on this?

146
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,767
Of course, Mother!

147
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:43,972
Incidentally, where were you
and what have been doing up so late?

148
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:46,307
I was practicing the willow
in the rehearsal room.

149
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,209
Are you able to do it now?

150
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,811
No, not yet...

151
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:52,380
But I will work hard,
so that I do not disgrace myself

152
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,682
as the successor of the
great actress, Midori Kurenai!

153
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:57,952
Yes, well, it's late, so go to sleep now.

154
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:00,147
I will. Good night.

155
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:11,466
We'd better report
this incident to the Miss.

156
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,401
What do you think she'll do?

157
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,868
Beats me.

158
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,931
"Kurenai Theater Studio"

159
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,780
The next production of "Lady Detective"

160
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,215
is about a young girl,

161
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,751
who shows up at a mystery author's place,
claiming to be a fan

162
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:32,453
and proceeds to play out a
game of death. It's a two-person play.

163
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,221
"Lady Detective"
and proceeds to play out a
game of death. It's a two-person play.

164
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:35,323
"Lady Detective"
It's also the play that launched
our studio head's career.

165
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:38,426
"Lady Detective"
The young girl, whom our
studio head played back then,

166
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:40,528
"Lady Detective"
hasn't been cast yet,

167
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,164
"Lady Detective"
but there's no doubt Ayaka
will be chosen for that role.

168
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:43,731
But there's no doubt Ayaka
will be chosen for that role.

169
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:46,801
Ayaka must be a very good actress.

170
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,102
Of course!

171
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:52,040
After all, she was adopted for her
promising talent as an actress.

172
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,977
I hear the studio head plans to
make this performance her last

173
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,680
and retire to let Ayaka take over.

174
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,952
Is everyone for Ayaka
becoming the new studio head?

175
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:05,720
What an odd thing to ask.

176
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,288
Of course, we're for it.

177
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,625
Ayaka is serious about her work
and she doesn't give herself airs.

178
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,594
The studio head wants everyone to
assemble in the rehearsal room.

179
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,255
Oh, okay.

180
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,272
Is everybody here?

181
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:28,776
I will now announce who will play
opposite me in our next production.

182
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,245
At long last, this day has come.

183
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,848
Everything I've endured up
until now has been worth it.

184
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,281
Come in.

185
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,657
This is Kaworuko Kurushima.

186
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,694
I'm sure you all know her
from the TV dramas she's been in.

187
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:49,797
She will be playing opposite me.

188
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,233
I'm Kurushima. I look forward
to working with you!

189
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,167
What?!

190
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,035
Why?

191
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,403
It's not Ayaka?

192
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:57,939
I never expected a guest
performer from the outside.

193
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,742
Wh-What's going on here?

194
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,111
I'm honored, Ms. Kurenai.

195
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,912
I never imagined I would
get to play a part

196
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,514
-That woman...
-in "Lady Detective".

197
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,849
It's like a dream come true!

198
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,450
I expect much of you.

199
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,451
Do your best.

200
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:11,440
I will.

201
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,747
You bitch!

202
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,628
Mother, what is the meaning of this?!

203
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:23,331
Are you saying I am not good enough?!

204
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,400
Yes, you still have a long way to go.

205
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,336
I do not understand! How am I lacking?!
Please explain it to me!

206
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:31,739
Listen to me.

207
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:34,075
If you think your expression and
your voice are all there is to acting,

208
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,643
you are greatly mistaken.

209
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:38,980
Unless you are focused down to
the very tips of your fingernails,

210
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,715
it cannot be called acting.

211
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:42,617
Uh, what are you talking about?

212
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,052
Don't play dumb.

213
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,486
I am referring to last night's incident.

214
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,388
Wh-What do you mean?

215
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:49,190
You are so hopeless.

216
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,093
I told you to drop this pitiful act.

217
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,327
Ms. Kurenai...

218
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,896
So there you have it.

219
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:58,399
My mind is occupied with
the production right now.

220
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,594
You're distracting me, so please leave.

221
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,204
If it galls you, go and polish your craft.

222
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,682
She saw through me?

223
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:19,020
No, it can't be.
My performance was perfect.

224
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,088
I get it!

225
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:22,682
I bet those bastards ratted me out!

226
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,899
What a ham.

227
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,635
What's with that piss-poor performance?!

228
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,872
You think you can take my place
with that level of skill?

229
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,907
You've got some nerve!

230
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:42,243
You should give up the part!

231
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,872
That's it. I can just
force her to give it up.

232
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:56,057
What? We never ratted you out!

233
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:58,459
Well, we'll just say that you didn't.

234
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,861
Anyway, about the money...

235
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,163
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm calling about.

236
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:06,122
Hey, I'll pay you double,
so would you do me a favor?

237
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,007
Miss Kurushima, what's the matter?!

238
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,280
Who did this?! Who would
do such a terrible thing?!

239
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,149
It's okay, Ayaka!

240
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,317
If you did this for my sake,

241
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:26,053
please don't do anything
like this ever again!

242
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,956
I'm not bothered by this at all.

243
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,253
I mean it.

244
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,932
Thank you for what you said earlier.

245
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:41,135
To be honest, I was happy
to accept the role,

246
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,871
but I felt bad about taking it from you.

247
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:47,074
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

248
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,702
Then turn it down from the get go!

249
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:53,881
What do you make of that?

250
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,441
I hope she's not up to something.

251
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,956
Yes!

252
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:03,324
Well? Are you having fun?

253
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:08,462
Y-Yes. Um, I'm sorry,
but it's getting late, so I...

254
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:12,366
A little longer won't hurt, right?
We've just gotten to be friends.

255
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,435
But...

256
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:16,837
Yo, cutie.

257
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:17,972
May I help you?

258
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:18,706
Is she the one?

259
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:19,440
Yup.

260
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,742
Woohoo! Super foxy.

261
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,344
Well, I'll leave the rest to you.

262
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:24,445
Okay.

263
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,414
A-Ayaka, wait...

264
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,507
Okay, you're coming with us.

265
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,755
P-Please let me go!

266
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:37,425
Sorry, we're not letting you go.

267
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:39,727
Please, I beg of you!

268
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,230
I have an important rehearsal tomorrow!

269
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,465
Drink this and we'll let you go.

270
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:45,967
What is that?

271
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,035
A medicine that'll make your voice pretty.

272
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,470
You're lying.

273
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,404
Okay, hold her.

274
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,405
Now, drink it down in one go.

275
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,733
Hey, did you hear? Did you hear?

276
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,502
Miss Kaworuko's lost her voice!

277
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:24,005
I wonder what happened.
Maybe it's the pressure.

278
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,274
Who knows?

279
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,643
I wonder what could have happened.

280
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:30,873
She was so enthusiastic.

281
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:37,884
If you're going to blame someone,
blame this woman, Kaworuko.

282
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:42,123
Wh-What?

283
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:44,625
Assemble all the troupe members
in the rehearsal room!

284
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,560
I have an important
announcement to make!

285
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,995
Yes, Ma'am.

286
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:51,165
I guess that means I'm the lead now.

287
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,167
Wait just a minute.

288
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,003
Do you not want to know
what the announcement is?

289
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:57,738
What?

290
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:01,075
The next production will be canceled
and the troupe will also be disbanded.

291
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:04,533
Additionally, I will be dissolving
the arrangement to adopt you.

292
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,083
It's your doing, isn't it?

293
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,951
Wh-What is?

294
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:14,221
I've told you to drop the pitiful act!

295
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:17,625
Don't take me for a fool!
You cannot deceive my eyes!

296
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,759
This is a misunderstanding!

297
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,330
If this is about the other night,
it really was nothing!

298
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,300
I was reborn when you took me in!

299
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,203
I am so glad that I met you!

300
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:32,473
Thanks to you, I learned
the joys of performing

301
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:34,709
and found hope to live by!

302
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,712
Words cannot express
how thankful I am to you!

303
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:40,448
Oh, Mother!

304
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,616
This is disgraceful! Get away from me!

305
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,852
At any rate, the decision
has already been made!

306
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:48,155
I've also informed my attorney!

307
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,850
This is goodbye.

308
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:55,586
What the hell, you damn hag?!

309
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,936
It saddens me that you
would call me a damn hag.

310
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:04,200
Don't say such sad things.

311
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:08,175
I've done everything for your sake.

312
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:11,445
My instruction may have been harsh,

313
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,949
but what you did is not
something that can be overlooked.

314
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,151
But if you are willing to
acknowledge your mistake

315
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,453
and make amends for what you did...

316
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:23,758
If you still wish to continue
acting at that point,

317
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:28,763
I'll talk to a theater troupe
I know on your behalf.

318
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,264
It's okay.

319
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:32,433
You can still start over.

320
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:36,871
With your talents, I'm sure you
can become a wonderful actress.

321
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:38,205
Cut the crap!

322
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,373
Pardon me?

323
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,142
Shut your damn mouth!

324
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,277
I've had enough of your pompous ass!

325
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,712
What's that?

326
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:49,417
Like hell I'm gonna play house
with you for that!

327
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,621
If I can't get your fame
and fortune, there's no point!

328
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,723
Don't you get it?!

329
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,591
I am sorry...

330
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:01,695
I am truly sorry that it
had to come to this.

331
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,754
Like sorry's gonna cut it, you dumbass!

332
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,600
Just you watch!

333
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,969
Since it's come to this,
I've found my resolve!

334
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:09,663
"Ayaka Kurenai"

335
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,673
I'll end up suffering the same fate,

336
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:15,543
but if she dies before
she dissolves the adoption,

337
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,913
at the very least,
her estate will go to me.

338
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:20,981
Go to Hell!

339
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,817
What?

340
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,385
Wh-Why?

341
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:25,953
Don't you get it?

342
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,621
When did you get in here?!

343
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,291
Hey, what is this?! Why?!

344
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,860
Someone untied the thread first.

345
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,928
Huh?

346
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:39,767
That person accessed
Hell Link last night

347
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:43,070
and untied the red thread just earlier.

348
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,537
What did you say?

349
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,632
Your grievance has been heard.

350
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,622
It's too late now.

351
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,923
Give it up.

352
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:05,626
Why?! I was first!

353
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,061
What's going on?!

354
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,229
Answer me!

355
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,288
Hey, hold it!

356
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:15,836
What is this?

357
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:16,996
I'm on stage?

358
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:24,144
Feel like acknowledging
your own guilt yet?

359
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:25,179
Like hell!

360
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,983
If you don't acknowledge it,
you'll be going to Hell.

361
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,651
You don't mind that?

362
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,186
W-Well...

363
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,687
I don't want to go to Hell!

364
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,790
Yes, I acknowledge it. So...

365
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,925
Psyche!

366
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:38,914
What?

367
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:43,163
Whose voice was that?!

368
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:44,528
Me!

369
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,703
Hey, hey, your performance is all wrong!

370
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:50,938
You can't just pay lip service,

371
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,841
you have to speak from
the bottom of your heart.

372
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:56,377
Yes, I truly feel bad about Kaworuko...

373
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,679
Serves her right!

374
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,381
What the hell are you?!

375
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:01,615
Ow!

376
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:04,585
My! What is this play?

377
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,020
This is far too tawdry...

378
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,511
No! It's not my fault!

379
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:15,428
Wh-What? What is going on here?

380
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,033
That hurts!

381
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,035
Wait... Stop!

382
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:23,037
That hurts! That hurts!

383
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,938
Stop!

384
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,850
Stop! I've had enough of this acting!

385
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,583
We want to hear the words of
your true self, not your character.

386
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:48,596
B-Believe me, this is my true self.

387
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:51,895
No, no, that's not right.

388
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:56,470
Come now.

389
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,941
Damn it! If you want to
hear it that badly, I'll tell you!

390
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,544
I don't really give a damn about acting!

391
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:06,080
It's just a stepping stone to me!

392
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,715
For me to rise up in the world!

393
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:11,719
That's right. I've worked hard
to learn the craft of acting,

394
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,722
so I'm going to deceive people
for all they're worth!

395
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:18,025
At times, I'll be the great actress
that everybody admires!

396
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,828
At other times, I'll be
the elegant lady of the house!

397
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,897
At yet other times, I'll be
the scandalous temptress!

398
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:24,932
And at yet other times...

399
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:28,231
So, which is your true self?

400
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,508
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

401
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:37,444
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

402
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:40,242
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

403
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,517
Care to give death a try?

404
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:02,202
Where am I?

405
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:05,272
It was a convincing performance.

406
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:08,298
The best you've ever been.

407
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,776
I consign this grievance to Hell...

408
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:31,031
Oh, sorry, coming through.

409
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,466
Hey, sorry, get that for me?

410
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:33,490
Sure!

411
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:54,788
"Kaworuko Kurushima"

412
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:59,226
"Kaworuko Kurushima"
Your grievance shall be avenged.

413
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:00,158
"Kaworuko Kurushima"

414
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:20,073
Always a dead end

415
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:26,746
There is no escape

416
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:34,854
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

417
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:39,120
And I'll let it fly

418
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,533
This place is ephemeral

419
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:58,511
An eternity that binds me

420
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:05,518
Coming or going

421
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:17,089
All that passes by are dreams

422
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:30,242
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

423
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,246
Your name?

424
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:34,847
Chie Tanuma.

425
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:37,316
You hate him?

426
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:41,053
I mean, because of him, Yuko is...

427
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,822
And she loved him!

428
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:46,192
She really loved him, and yet...

429
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,294
Your wish?

430
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:51,597
Banish him to Hell for me!

431
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:55,468
Your grievance has been heard.

432
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:55,768
Next time, "Silent Friendship".

433
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,471
"Hell Girl
Silent Friendship"
Next time, "Silent Friendship".

434
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:00,971
"Hell Girl
Silent Friendship"
