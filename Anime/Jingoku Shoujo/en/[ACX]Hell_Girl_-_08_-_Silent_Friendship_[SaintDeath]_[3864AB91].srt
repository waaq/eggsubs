It is said that life's encounters

Tangled up in the threads of fate...

...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,171
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

6

helpless to reap shall be yours.

Welcome.

38
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:47,880
I won't be staying long.

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,083
Don't be in such a rush.

Why don't you at least have a
cup of coffee, Ms. Seira Yamamoto?

Don't be ridiculous.

45
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,813
Celebrities are always in the public eye,

46
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:22,849
so it must be inconvenient
when you want to have fun.

I would like it if you would
trust me on that score.

Please be careful in the future.

50
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,061
Scumbag.

51
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:38,131
Oh, have you heard of Hell Girl?

52
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:40,565
Apparently, she'll avenge your grievances.

53
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,040
That attitude hurts.

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,371
Right on the dot.

00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:55,771

This was the right thing to do.

58
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:21,435
Yuko, I'll make sure you're avenged.

59
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,292
What's the matter, Ai?

60
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:44,697
Guess what, Grandma? I met a girl.

61
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:47,066
A girl?

62
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,601
Yes.

63
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,237
It felt like she was a dear
old acquaintance for some reason.

64
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,102
A dear old acquaintance?

65
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:57,610
You say such odd things, child.

66
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,307
Odd? You're right, it is odd.

67
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,148
Well, it seems you have another message.

68
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,347
Ow!

69
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,616
Don't use the computer while you're eating!

70
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,818
It's bad manners!

71
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:42,049
Throwing a boiled egg is
bad manners, too, I'll bet.

72
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:45,722
All right.

73
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:51,430
They say the top reason
why kids become delinquents

74
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,966
is because the parents
lead dissolute lives.

75
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,503
Oh-ho, then we've got
nothing to worry about.

76
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:00,199
After all, look at what a
wonderful dad you've got.

77
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,045
I'm kidding.

78
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:10,082
Oh, yeah, Tsugumi,
have you heard of Hell Girl?

79
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:13,319
Hell Girl? The agent of revenge?

80
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,324
Yeah, that's it. Do any of your friends
know anything about it?

81
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:22,261
You know, like someone who's seen
the Hell Link page or something.

82
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:23,963
Are you going to write an article on it?

83
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:27,099
Yeah. "The truth behind
the agent of revenge!"

84
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,498
Sounds like a seller, huh?

85
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,836
Tsugumi?

86
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,343
You'd better not.

87
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:40,176
Huh? Why?

88
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,018
Tsugumi?

89
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:47,485
Hey...

90
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:52,280
Care to give death a try?

91
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,392
Tsugumi!

92
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,502
You okay?

93
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:06,172
Tsugumi, hang in there!

94
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,332
Hey...

95
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:13,066
Hell... Girl...

96
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,989
He's laughing...

97
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,457
That bastard...

98
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:28,961
Why? Why won't you come, Hell Girl?

99
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,929
"Amano"

100
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,602

00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes. Thanks to this sucker,
doing research has gotten a lot easier.

102
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,111
Tsugumi wasn't very energetic today.

103
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,614
Oh, she was just in a bad mood.

104
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:51,984
She's getting to be at a difficult age.

105
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm sure it's tough,
since you've got work to do,

106
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,453
but why don't you take her to
an amusement park for once?

107
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:01,961
I wonder if she'd enjoy that.
She's precocious.

108
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,498
She may seem that way,
but she's still a kid at heart.

109
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,695
Right, then maybe
I'll do that next weekend.

110
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,741
Amusement park, huh?

111
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,505
I seriously doubt she'd enjoy it.

You hate that man?

130
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:07,219
Yes.

131
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,522
Enough to want to kill him?

132
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:11,690
I mean...

133
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,560
Because of him, Yuko is...

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,728
Wanyuudou.

135
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,593
Yes, Miss.

136
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,858
Take it.

137
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:31,310
If you really want retribution,

138
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,847
untie that red thread.

139
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:40,719
By untying the thread, you will
enter into a covenant with me.

140
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:45,624
The object of your vengeance will
immediately be banished to Hell.

141
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,285
To Hell...

142
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:53,165
However,

143
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,367
once you have your retribution,

144
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,871
you will have to pay
the price for it as well.

145
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,005
Price?

146
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:02,841
Curses come home to roost.

147
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:08,447
If you enter into the covenant,
your soul will also go to Hell.

148
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,683
We're talking after you die.

149
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,018
You'll never see Heaven,

150
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:18,388
and your soul will wander
for eternity in pain and agony.

151
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,596
No!

152
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,631
No! H-Help!

153
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,657
Help!

154
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:46,380
All that remains is for you to decide.

155
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,530
"Tasty Milk"

156
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,880
I left you some milk.

157
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,582
I don't want it.

158
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:19,885
Drink it. Or you boobs won't get bigger.

159
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,220
That's sexual harassment!

160
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,822
It's parental love.

161
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,557
You're still looking into it, huh?

162
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,226
Huh? Into what?

163
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,527
Hell Girl.

164
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:32,464
N-No, I'm not. I'm not
looking into it anymore.

165
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:33,465
Liar.

166
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:36,035
It's true.

167
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:40,369
I checked your browsing history
while you were taking a bath, Hajime.

168
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,844
Well, if you want to keep
researching that much, that's fine,

169
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,179
but be careful, okay?

170
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:50,983
Y-Yeah, I'll be careful.

171
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,348
Give me the milk.

172
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:54,616
Sure.

173
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,695
Tsugumi...

174
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,560
H-Hey!

175
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,600
I-I can see...

176
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,589
What?

177
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,468
A hamburger shop...

178
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:23,804
Welcome!

179
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:28,687
Tanuma, didn't you quit?

180
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,255
I came to see the manager.

181
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:31,256
Is he here?

182
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:32,257
Yeah.

183
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,724
Boss!

184
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:37,621
Yeah. What's up?

185
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,968
Oh, it's you, Tanuma.

186
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:47,873
What is it? The last of your pay
should have been deposited already.

187
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,000
Could I have a moment of your time?

188
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:56,849
You really saw the number 39?

189
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,146
Yeah.

190
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,520
You dummy.

191
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,157
I told you to stay home,
but you just had to come along.

192
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:09,560
But... you can't see it...

193
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll... take you to
an amusement park sometime.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,201
Huh?

195
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,964
You know, an amusement park.

196
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,115
What is it?

197
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,879
What's this about?
Dragging me out here like this?

198
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,724
Oh, yeah, how is Kido doing?

199
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:42,227
I was so shocked when
I heard she'd jumped.

200
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,497
She didn't seem like she had such troubles.

201
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:47,533
Did you find out why she did it?

202
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,024
Was it disappointment in love
or something like that, after all?

203
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,073
You pushed her.

204
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:56,508
What?

205
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:59,144
Don't play dumb! I know!

206
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,713
Come on now, what are you saying?

207
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,882
That's an awful accusation to make.

208
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,084
Yuko had told me about it.

209
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:10,689
That you were cooking the books
and stealing money from the store!

210
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,592
Yuko had feelings for you,

211
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,394
so instead of reporting it to the police,

212
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,629
she said she was going
to talk you out of it.

213
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:19,598
That she'd get you
to return all the money,

214
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,733
so it'd be like it never happened!

215
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,770
She called me on my cell phone that day.

216
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,840
That she was on her way to see you.

217
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,009
Yuko seriously loved you, you know!

218
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,212
And yet...

219
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,614
You've got it all wrong, Tanuma.

220
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,583
I never pushed her.

221
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,351
Don't lie to me!

222
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,820
I was watching!

223
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,692
That day, I was worried,
so I went to the building...

224
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:47,954
And then...

225
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,130
No, that wasn't me.

226
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,465
It was you.

227
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,033
You have proof of this?

228
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,302
I don't care about proof.

229
00:16:57,302 --> 00:17:00,066
I saw you. That's more than enough.

230
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,444
It won't do you any good
to go to the police.

231
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,579
I've got an alibi for that day.

232
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,083
I'm not going to the police.

233
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,584
What do you plan to do?

234
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:15,687
I'm going to have Hell Girl
get revenge for me.

235
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,923
Hell Girl?

236
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:20,551
That thing that everyone's
clamoring about online?

237
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:25,898
You seriously believe that?

238
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:30,102
What are you, stupid?
There's no way she really exists.

239
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,433
She does.

240
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:37,242
Before I had Ai Enma get revenge for me,

241
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,378
I wanted to ask you one thing.

242
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:43,448
I wanted to know what you
thought of that day.

243
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,617
I understand well now.

244
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,586
That was no accident.

245
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:51,356
You don't care one bit about Yuko!

246
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,058
I understand well now...

247
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,958
Poor Yuko...

248
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,131
Chie...

249
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,033
Chie, the truth is,
you're the one that I've always...

250
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,671
Don't play with me!

251
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,372
What kind of person are you?!

252
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:09,942
I never thought you were
this kind of person!

253
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,376
You're disgusting.

254
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,900
What?!

255
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,516
That's some friendship.

256
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,916
But you were too honest with me!

257
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,924
Hey!

258
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,084
Stop it!

259
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,959
Your grievance has been heard.

260
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:40,172
Ow...

261
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:41,537
Hajime!

262
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:44,370
Hey, you okay?

263
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:16,875
Somebody!

264
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,502
Somebody!

265
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,465
Over here.

266
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:41,864
Over here!

267
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,182
Wh-What's going on?

268
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,707
Hey, where in the world are...

269
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:03,722
Yuko!

270
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:06,850
Oh, I missed you, Goro!

271
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,655
Quit it!

272
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:18,970
Y-You idiot! Stop this!

273
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,840
Why? Let's fall together.

274
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,105
Come, we'll both go this time.

275
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,143
D-Don't be ridiculous!

276
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:40,659
O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness...

277
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,528
Demeaning and bringing harm to others...

278
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:46,190
A damned soul, wallowing in sin...

279
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:50,023
Care to give death a try?

280
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:07,615
Betray another's affections, and you
will be judged by those affections.

281
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:13,687
I consign this grievance to Hell...

282
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:35,847
Hajime, did you find anything?

283
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,883
No, nothing.

284
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,885
So, he disappeared...

285
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,182
Yeah...

286
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:46,258
Hajime...

287
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:47,859
Come on, let's go.

288
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:50,095
Okay.

289
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:52,154
I'll give you a ride home, too.

290
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,204
That girl...

291
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,872
You know her?

292
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:02,674
Ai Enma.

293
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:03,942
What?

294
00:22:03,942 --> 00:22:05,710
She's Hell Girl.

295
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,075
What?!

296
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,185
Here.

297
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:26,832
Yuko, I had feelings for him, too.

298
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:30,669
That could have been me, instead of you.

299
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,933
So, I...

300
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:40,144
