1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,895
It is said that life's
encounters are governed by fate.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,030
Tangled up in the threads of fate...

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,633
...are the ill-fated blossoms,
pitiful and frail.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,171
Lost in anger, sorrow, and tears...

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,907
Beyond the veil of midnight,

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:20,243
the retribution that you are
helpless to reap shall be yours.

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:29,085
A butterfly, hanging upside down,
that will head towards the light sometime

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,257
The reflection in the mirror
as we cut our hair

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,629
Footsteps echoing
in the hallway during class

10
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,935
The sound of rain follows us ceaselessly

11
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:52,676
Purely what we feel is blinding
and can take the shape of a sweet flower

12
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:55,378
Or the shape of a poisonous fruit

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,114
Rain again today

14
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:05,355
I want to link that day to now, sky-to-sky

15
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,991
In this craziness, uncertainty

16
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:15,966
Will we be able to leave a trace
of each of our emotions somewhere?

17
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,768
In this craziness, you gave me life

18
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:26,610
To what bounds can we
safeguard one emotion?

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,279
In this craziness, uncertainty

20
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:37,387
Will we be able to leave a
trace of each of our selves somewhere?

21
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,056
In this craziness, you gave me life

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:48,293
To what bounds can we
safeguard each of our selves?

23
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,273
Save me.

24
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:16,882
"Glass Scenery"

25
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,495
I hate fog.

26
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,670
It makes me afraid of what's
ahead of us on the road.

27
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,679
If I could see ahead,

28
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:51,342
I could be strong even if
something bad was coming.

29
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,922
Kids shouldn't think
such complicated things.

30
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,056
I'm not a kid!

31
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,791
You're a kid, any way you look at it.

32
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,593
I'm your guardian, Hajime.

33
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,288
Oh, is that so?

34
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:08,066
Be careful, okay? Don't speed.

35
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,626
Yes, Ma'am, Miss Guardian.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,975
A music box?

37
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,420
Where's it coming from?

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,756
It can't be from outside...

39
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,656
Is the radio on?

40
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,317
Watch out!

41
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,770
You okay?

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,004
Do not go.

43
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,205
What?

44
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,807
Turn back.

45
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,008
Do not go.

46
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:51,999
Is it Ai Enma?!

47
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:06,613
A sanatorium?

48
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,468
"Reception"

49
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,960
"Reception"
Excuse me?! Hello?!

50
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,846
Oh, excuse me!

51
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,643
Hajime!

52
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:38,980
There's...no one here.

53
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:45,652
Wanna go back?

54
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,661
I'm okay.

55
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,539
You're sure?

56
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,044
Yeah, that music box was
playing in the scene I saw.

57
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,012
Tell me stuff like that sooner.

58
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:01,980
Sorry.

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,582
Anything else?

60
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:05,283
She said, "Save me."

61
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,251
What?

62
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:10,278
A girl's voice said, "Save me."

63
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:21,366
It looks like there really
isn't anybody here.

64
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,467
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,269
Let's make one round and then go home.

66
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,634
Okay.

67
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:53,899
Well?

68
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,634
Is this the same as the scene you saw?

69
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,068
It's a little different.

70
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:58,303
Different?

71
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,739
The view outside is the same,

72
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:04,009
but I feel like it's different somehow.

73
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,601
I see.

74
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,482
Something must have set it off.

75
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,083
All right, let's go home.

76
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,277
Okay.

77
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,284
Uh...Who are you?

78
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:31,768
Hello.

79
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:42,280
I see. So your name is Nina?

80
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,048
Yes.

81
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,849
I'm Tsugumi.

82
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:45,984
Tsugumi...

83
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:50,956
Yup, and this is my father.

84
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:53,024
Father...

85
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,355
That's nice.

86
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:59,329
Because Nina doesn't have a father.

87
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,436
This place is quiet.

88
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,370
Yes.

89
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,105
Where are the other patients?

90
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,140
Nina's the only one here right now.

91
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,142
I didn't know.

92
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:13,979
What about the doctors and nurses?

93
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,815
I haven't seen any around yet.

94
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,282
They're here.

95
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:24,889
So they were around.

96
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,948
I'm going to go say hello.

97
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,026
Oh...

98
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,328
Say, why did you come here?

99
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,830
What?

100
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,565
You had some business here, right?

101
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,266
Oh, um...

102
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,737
My father's a friend
of the director here.

103
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,969
We happened to be in the area,
so we decided to drop by for a visit.

104
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,847
That's strange...

105
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,644
I was sure she came this way...

106
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,921
Excuse me...

107
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:30,321
Nina, your eyes are a pretty color.

108
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,456
Thank you.

109
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:32,924
Your hair is beautiful, too.

110
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:35,393
You can touch it.

111
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:36,621
Go ahead.

112
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,629
O-Okay.

113
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,300
Wow, it's silky smooth!

114
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,637
So warm...

115
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:00,583
Her hand is so cold...

116
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,233
Were you able to say hello?

117
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,135
Yeah, I guess.

118
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:20,472
The director might be out today.

119
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,874
He goes out a lot on the weekends.

120
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:23,875
What?

121
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,910
The director?

122
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,645
Ow!

123
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:28,346
What?!

124
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,348
I'll tell you later.

125
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:33,118
Say, you're staying
the night tonight, right?

126
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:33,985
What?

127
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,788
There are a lot of open rooms,
so it'll be fine.

128
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:39,090
Nina will make arrangements for you.

129
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,592
Oh, but...

130
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:44,362
Sorry, but we have
a hotel reservation in town.

131
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,954
You won't make it.

132
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,962
You won't be able to
go back in this fog.

133
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,086
Is that the girl?

134
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,588
The one that accessed Hell Link...

135
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:11,823
Probably.

136
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:13,992
I did a cursory check earlier,

137
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,984
but there weren't any
computers here in the facility.

138
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:23,802
Furthermore, the sanatorium itself is strange.

139
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,403
Against whom does that girl...

140
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,998
No, against what does
that girl have a grievance?

141
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:31,743
Not to mention, that girl...

142
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:33,176
Stop!

143
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,926
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,261
We'll stop thinking about this.

145
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:53,531
I want to go home, Hajime.

146
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,733
Yeah, let's go home.

147
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,031
Just as soon as this fog lets up.

148
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:08,513
With things getting to this point,
it can't be a coincidence.

149
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,480
Yeah.

150
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,050
That journalist named
Shibata or something

151
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,954
is definitely acting on info
he's obtained ahead of time.

152
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:17,889
That source would have to be...

153
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,652
The Miss...

154
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,795
What for?

155
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,096
Who knows?

156
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:29,901
It might be that the Miss is
doing it unconsciously, too.

157
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:32,937
I don't understand the Miss lately.

158
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,606
To be honest with you.

159
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,474
You have a point.

160
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,409
Take this case for instance.

161
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:39,577
Yeah.

162
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:43,014
I never thought she'd act
on a request like that.

163
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,847
An access from a soul...

164
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,683
Hell Girl...

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,862
You took so long.

166
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,023
I was getting tired of waiting.

167
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,544
I cannot accept your request.

168
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:14,879
What?

169
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,248
What do you mean, you can't?

170
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:19,517
You're supposed to avenge me, right?

171
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,353
That's your job, isn't it?

172
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:25,322
I cannot avenge your grievance.

173
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,988
Oh, wait!

174
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,325
Wait, Hell Girl!

175
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,570
Nina!

176
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,140
Liar.

177
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,142
Ni...na?

178
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:47,946
Hey, you just called out to Hell Girl?

179
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:50,148
But it doesn't matter.

180
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:51,549
I don't care anymore.

181
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:54,677
Because, now, Nina has...

182
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,259
Aren't you kind of hungry?

183
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,727
Shall we go have dinner?

184
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:03,728
Wh-What?

185
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:04,956
Let's go.

186
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,634
Come on, let's eat.

187
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,512
What's wrong?

188
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:23,639
Hurry up!

189
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:32,023
Then, shall I make some tea?

190
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,321
Wow, thank you!

191
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:38,896
Your father is so nice.

192
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:41,566
Wh-What? Uh, yeah...

193
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:44,569
He's not anything like Nina's father.

194
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,140
Because Nina's father
left Nina and disappeared.

195
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,508
I didn't know...

196
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,010
What about your mother?

197
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,379
What? My mother?

198
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,314
I wonder if I had one.

199
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,680
I don't know about a mother.

200
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:05,456
Nina, could I ask you something?

201
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,691
What?

202
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,560
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to,

203
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,996
but you accessed Hell Link, didn't you?

204
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:15,366
Hell Link? Yeah, I did.

205
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,235
You have a grievance against someone?

206
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,036
Yeah.

207
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,038
I see. Against whom?

208
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,972
My father.

209
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,611
He left me all by myself
and I was lonely.

210
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:31,983
I hated him for a long time,
because I blamed him for it.

211
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,651
But I'm okay now.

212
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:34,752
What?

213
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:36,888
I'm not lonely anymore.

214
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,591
I have you, Tsugumi,
and I have a new father, too.

215
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:42,293
What?

216
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,996
You'll stay with me forever, won't you?

217
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:48,299
You won't leave Nina all alone, right?

218
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,835
What are you saying, Nina?

219
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:56,474
Nina, we just, well...
dropped by to visit the director.

220
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,843
There's no director here.

221
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,045
What?

222
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,606
There's no one else here, except Nina.

223
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:11,589
From now on, let's live happily
together here, just the three of us.

224
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,592
We're a family now, after all.

225
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,287
Nina...

226
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,295
Okay, Tsugumi?

227
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:25,937
Hajime!

228
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:28,172
Tsugumi, what's wrong?

229
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:29,969
Stay away from me!

230
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,080
Nina, you...

231
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,916
You're the same.

232
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,316
You're the same as Father.

233
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,648
Tsugumi!

234
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,656
I won't forgive you.

235
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,160
We're running straight out to the car!

236
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:58,997
Hajime...

237
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,949
I know we're under orders
from the Miss, but...

238
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,552
I never expected to be helping him.

239
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:18,322
He is someone who is unrelated
to this particular job.

240
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:20,658
What's going on here?

241
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:21,559
Tsugumi...

242
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,117
Tsugumi!

243
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,075
Hajime!

244
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,303
Hajime?

245
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,396
It's your fault, Tsugumi.

246
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:01,593
Now, come with Nina.

247
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,600
You're...

248
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,603
Hi, there.

249
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,282
Tsugumi!

250
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,290
Tsugumi! Hey!

251
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,561
Thank goodness...

252
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:51,582
Start!

253
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,311
Start, you piece of junk!

254
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:10,635
Damn it!

255
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:11,932
Nooo!

256
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:19,773
Stop!

257
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,947
Stop this.

258
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,955
Hell...Girl...

259
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:50,074
Tsugumi...

260
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,305
Hell...Girl?

261
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:59,317
You didn't avenge Nina!

262
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,085
I have no use for you anymore!

263
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,720
Don't get in my way!

264
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,090
Stop this. You must not involve them.

265
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,059
It's their fault!

266
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,728
They're trying to leave
Nina all alone again!

267
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:14,926
Just like Nina's father!
Leaving Nina by herself again!

268
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,003
You are not Nina.

269
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,138
Wh-What are you saying?

270
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:22,940
I am Nina!

271
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,931
Remember.

272
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:45,287
Your mistress died.

273
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,295
Nina...

274
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,069
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

275
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:26,502
Hey!

276
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,225
What does this mean?

277
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,022
I don't know.

278
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,178
This is the place...

279
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:08,112
What?

280
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:11,309
The scene I saw...

281
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,992
A doll...

282
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:40,010
I'm right here!

283
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,246
I'll be waiting!

284
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:45,249
I'll be good and I'll be waiting, so...

285
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:46,951
So...

286
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:50,321
Come get me, Father!

287
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,857
I don't want to be alone!

288
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:55,348
It's so lonely!

289
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:58,753
Save me...

290
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:06,635
She took on Nina's feelings...

291
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,807
Always a dead end

292
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:26,480
There is no escape

293
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,588
I place my sorrow upon a bird in the sky

294
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:39,582
And I'll let it fly

295
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,301
This place is ephemeral

296
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:58,245
An eternity that binds me

297
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:05,186
Coming or going

298
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:17,155
All that passes by are dreams

299
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,411
"This is a work of fiction and any
similarities between the names of
characters or organizations in this story
and actual names are entirely coincidental."

300
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,180
Your name?

301
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,082
Miki Kamikawa.

302
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,117
You cannot escape?

303
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,887
That woman says I have to come every day.

304
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:42,890
That woman lives to hate people.

305
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,926
At this rate, those little ones will be...

306
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:48,195
Your wish?

307
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,333
Banish her to Hell for me!

308
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,469
Your grievance has been heard.

309
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:55,903
"Hell Girl
Bound Girl"

310
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:59,173
"Hell Girl
Bound Girl"
Next time, "Bound Girl".

311
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:01,673
"Hell Girl
Bound Girl"
